"I dont know what type of acct a ""brokerage account (long term)"" is.  You'll need to check with the brokerage.  If it is not part of your work and you opened it yourself, it could be a cash account or a retirement IRA account.

There are different acct types at these major brokers (not Robinhood though).

For the US:

Cash accts
- Pay taxes on capital gains.
- Put in cash savings and invest in stock, ETFs, mutual funds, etc.
- Unlimited funding

Retirement accts
- Traditional IRA (pay taxes on withdrawal at retirement)
- Roth IRA (income limits to contributing to one; pay no taxes on withdrawal as contributions are after-tax dollars)
- 401k (through your employer); some 401k allow buying anything; most limit to specific investments/funds
- Limited annual contributions and invest in stock, ETFs, mutual funds, etc.
- Can invest in bitcoin ETF in brokerage accounts...even 401k brokerage accounts.  If Fidelity manages your 401k, then a 401k brokerage acct is possible.

Healthcare Savings Acct
- Livelyme.com links to TDAmeritrade
- HSA money is YOUR money; yes, you can transfer money from your company HSA account at livelyme anytime and keep your company HSA account bank open.
- Limited annual contribution 
- Can buy stock and ETFs unlike other HSA banks
- Can invest in bitcoin ETF unlike other HSA banks
- tax free in; tax free out (for medical expenses)

Coverdell (Educational Savings Acct)
- Different than 529
- Can be opened in conjunction with 529
- Different withdrawal rules than 529
- Limited annual contribution 
- Can buy stock and ETFs unlike 529
- Can invest in bitcoin ETF unlike 529
- after-tax dollars in; tax free out (for educational expenses)

..........

Investments.

It's up to your risk tolerance and aggressiveness and age.

With any brokerage acct, you can invest in stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, bonds, currency, and crypto/pseudo-crypto (bitcoin ETF).  Some investment types may require approval.

Target date funds are the easiest. So are index funds. So are sector funds.

You can invest 90% in stable easy funds and be a little risky and use 10% of your assets to buy companies you like.  But buying companies is not always set it and forget it.  Buy low (cheap and on sale).  Sell high (expensive and overvalued).  Fidelity has great tools to help with this.  

If you like to drink Starbucks, do your research, and buy some Starbucks stock.

If you like to shop at Amazon, do your research, buy some Amazon stock.

While 10% may seem a lot, if your 90% grows 10% a year, and your 10% risk goes to $0, you're still at break even.  Believe me, Amazon, Starbucks, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Adobe, JNJ, ABBV, ProctorGamble, McDonalds, etc. will not go bankrupt any time soon.  Avoid utilities, airlines, and car companies.  TSLA will be okay bc they are a tech company; I'm talking about GM, Ford, Toyota, etc.  Buy mega caps and other stable companies.",positive

[No idea what you're rambling on about.  Income tax is a great way to pay for public functions, and the whole western world is heavy on this. USA would arguably be even more functional if it managed to tax some of the rich people and big corps properly as well.  I don't know what income tax you pay, but I pay 30%. In Denmark it's 45%. Yet our peoples are the happiest in the world. It's not like supply decrease because people have less money, shit just gets priced in accordance to how much money people have.  This also goes for your american dream, whatever percent the income tax would drop to 0  for, is the same price increase you'd see on everything. You probably don't understand this, but you would most likely become relatively more poor if everyone's income tax dropped to 0, because everyone would have more money with supply staying the same. The dollar value would also plummet.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uf3h58/aged_like_milk/i6sguy1/)

[Sure, they influence, but what did it really affect? Demand just shifted, pre-orders skyrocketed and people had to wait a little longer on their deliveries of goods. This because of ""Just in time"".  National food production in US suffered due to covid, exactly because ""just in time"" is so prevalent and tight even a single closed division of a meat factory would spoil meat. The worst cases I read of were livestock being slaughtered and the meat discarded because it was less profitable than keeping them alive and slaughter them later. Which is why Trump disregarded covid in order to keep many of these meat factories open. Food and profit, with profit obviously being the most important one.  Almost all of the problems USA experiences was caused by ""just in time"" and tight schedules instead of keeping warehouses with stock locally. That is what we're talking about. ""just in time"" collapses when you're not on time anymore, and this is a larger problem in USA than most other places, **combined** with the government shutting down parts of the logistic chain. There's more differences between USA and NZ than just how they handled the supply chains, people would eventually become sick and have to stay at home anyway, again, collapsing the supply chain JIT. Maybe it would happen more gradually, maybe they'd stock up locally, most likely not.  I can meet you halfway and say that your government was a catalyst to set off the chain reaction of the different components, JIT, inflation and political polarization, but make no mistake, their hand was still forced by COVID.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uf3h58/aged_like_milk/i6sjbc6/)

Low intrest rates for decade created hot economy, because it was much more lucrative to loan and invest money then to actually have it. Huge COVID hand outs in USA and EU kickstarted even bigger demand, while COVID restrictions around the world caused low supply.

If you get off this train, you better be ok with walking from that point.

I think TMTG is more like TSLA than GME but you do you. I’m long, and I believe this will be a Trillion dollar company within 10 years. Compared to FB’s IPO you get about 10 times the ownership per share as their IPO gave.",positive

[The market is pricing in an earnings peak for MU for sure.  I sold about half my position for a 10% loss, but kept some for the long term.  MU's most recent guidance does suggest at least a near term stagnation in EPS, which the market will punish harshly.    The DD that you need to do, is to figure out if you think this EPS stall is temporary or longer term.  I think look at their projections out towards 2025 and see if you think their capital investment plans can push EPS beyond the 2.50 mark.  If so, then the next 6 months could present a very good buying opportunity as the market punishes the short term stall.  If EPS is doomed to stagnate in the 2-2.20 range, then you'll see MU hold right around a 7 PE.](/r/stocks/comments/q6id0m/rstocks_daily_discussion_technicals_tuesday_oct/hgd3q3f/)

I don’t think MU is a hidden gem, but it’s a major player in its segment and it’s only one positively revised outlook away, after supply chain issues wane, from seeing growth again.  I wouldn’t blame you for selling though, right now semi/chip fab as an entire industry has been lackluster and that money may do better elsewhere short-term.](/r/stocks/comments/q6id0m/rstocks_daily_discussion_technicals_tuesday_oct/hgd3bqb/)

NASDAQ:Z / 6",positive
"Honestly, it's the best feeling in the world (to be out and starting fresh).  But I got out of NVDA stock yesterday very early and am only holding TSLA puts presently...",positive
Kinda of impressed how much of a Tesla fan Tom Gardner is on Twitter. Stock Advisor doesn’t mention it as much as he has been. Clearly seems to be one of his favorites (he first recommended TSLA in 2012 or 13).,positive
"No, because even when TSLA was in the high 300's, I knew that the company was nowhere near its full potential.

I recall that TSLA reached around 380 in summer of 2018, after Elon Musk's infamous ""take TSLA private at 420, funding secured"" tweet.  I understood why Elon wanted to take TSLA out of the public markets, because short seller and Mainstream Media attacks had become outrageously vicious since 2016.  However, Tesla at the time had just ramped Model 3 production to 5k units/week.  There was no Shanghai factory.  There were only vague hints that Tesla was creating an elite AI hardware and software group.  I believed that the Model Y compact crossover, which was not yet revealed at the time, would be Tesla's blockbuster product.

I didn't want to part with my shares in the high 300's.

Also, there's the matter of taxes.  Income taxes on long term capital gains would have been at least 15%, or maybe 20% for some shares sold, plus Net Income Investment Tax (another 3.8%), plus state income taxes, depending on my business income for the year.  The stock would have had to drop precipitously in order for me to buy back in and gain more shares. 

I wasn't confident that the stock price would fall below 300, given that Tesla had successfully met its Model 3 ramp goal of 5k units/year, albeit a few months late.

There was a risk that Tesla could have another breakout and leave the 300's behind before I could buy back in.

The logistics fiasco of early 2019 was something I couldn't have foreseen in mid-2018, and in any case, the resolution of those problems pushed TSLA to 420 and beyond around the end of 2019.  The breakout I expected did happen.  I just had no way of knowing exactly when it would occur.",positive

TSLA put for next Friday sounds like a big check,positive
"Taxing imaginary money is one of the dumbest things I've ever heard. If you tax unrealized gains, they all have to sell to realize them, which raises supply and lowers demand lowering the gains. They are unrealized precisely because they do not yet exist.

Elon Musk has like $200 billion in unrealized gains, but if he sold $200 billion TSLA stock the share price would go down 90% and he'd have \~$50 billion in realized gains.

This will never be implemented, it would lead to a 90% stock market crash and investment in hard assets. Everyone would take delivery on gold and silver and commodities would squeeze.",positive
Fun fact: you can make money off of GME and TSLA without actually believing in their cult.,positive
"$TSLA bro...

I love the stock , but maybe it goes up maybe it goes down nobody knows",positive
Even before COVID TSLA was way overvalued. They had a similar cap to Ford producing like 1% of the cars,positive
"At 19 you can certainly take on lots of risk as long as you understand it.    Options can be lucrative but in general unless your very lucky they don’t create real wealth long term.   For the few stories you see people being successful,  95% don’t really create the wealth with options because you have to be right on timing, direction and you end up limiting your gains.      Since you own TSLA take a look at its 3 years history, you would have made a fortune if you just bought and held the stock.  If you used options through that time because of the volatility of the stock some of your option trading would have resulted in 100% loss and others you may have made great gains if you bought and sold at the right time.   Options on Tesla could go up 100’s of percent, but due to volatility of the stock could evaporate quickly and you end up losing.   I wish you all the best in building your wealth and hope this advice helps along with others that are sent your way.   The good part that shows your maturity is your asking.   Good luck and hope you have a prosperous future.",positive
"You are underestimating the $NIO gang. We are all diamond-handed warriors, exactly like the $TSLA gang. 🙌💎🚀",positive

[Instead of buying options hoping price moves in your direction, consider selling nondirectional strategies. *E.g.* at close tomorrow, sell a put and a call $10 away from the share price, and buy a put and call $20 away from the share price. The idea is to sell the options closer to the money to collect a nice premium before earnings and then buy the position back after IV crush at the open.

"I think of it the opposite way. Selling options is low risk, as long as you own the shares (sell covered calls) or have the cash to cover the puts (sell cash secured puts). Say I own 100 TSLA, it's at $1000, and I sell an $1100 call for $10. Because each option has 100 shares and I sold for $10/share, that means the person who bought the call pays me $10x100 = $1,000. Now, if the stock ends up $1100 or higher on the strike date, my shares will be called away from me and the person will only pay me $1100 for them. I'm happy because I get my $1k and sold my shares at $1100, so it all sounds good, but if the shares went to $2k by that date I'd be sad because I missed out on all that profit. My profit is capped at the $1100 price. But if the shares are lower than $1100, the options won't be exercised because I agreed to sell them for $1100, but the person who bought the call can already buy them for cheaper than that.

So selling covered calls on shares you own is a way to trickle in cash on top of your normal gains or losses, but 1) you pay short term capital gains on them and 2) it limits your upside. If you have a stock you really believe in and it moons, but you sold covered calls, you miss out on the upside in return for guaranteed profit. That's why I consider selling safer. Buying calls is just throwing money at guesses, and it's very likely you lose your money. If I want to see all my money disappear, I'll buy calls.

Selling puts, same thing, you trickle in cash, and occasionally you'll be forced to buy a stock with the big pile of cash you have (i.e. the put will finish in the money and the buyer will exercise their right to sell you the stock at a higher price than market price). But you pick a stock you'd be happy to buy at that price, for example AAPL $140 or something, and you assume AAPL will go up past $140 even though it's $135 now (in this hypothetical example), and you're ok with being stuck with the shares.",positive

I’ve always noticed that with Tesla you have to buy calls based on the “prediction” for the current week for the week after. It usually comes true then. Like if someone said TSLA 1200C 4/8 you’d have to get them 4/14 instead because this week it isn’t happening. You just gotta spend extra on the premium for a better chance of hitting,positive
"[&gt;Even if AAPL doesn't invent self driving, they will probably perfect the technology. Especially when they will have the bankroll to pay for talented teams and employees from other companies in the future.  I don't think this is going to happen.  Creating a self-driving stack via ML is orders of magnitude more complex than engineering a phone or writing software for iOS. You can't just hire a few engineers from the competition and turn around an improved product after a year or two.  You need petabytes of real-world training data and teams of people to comb through it just to have a chance. And even with all that, success is not guaranteed - look at how much Tesla has struggled despite all the resources and talent they are throwing at the problem. Making small tweaks to the learning algorithm can result in drastic and unintended changes to the behavior of the software.  Self-driving is one of the hardest engineering problems of our time since it's basically attempting to create AI.  Based on that, IMO the most likely path forward for Apple is they design the hardware and interface but license the self-driving software from whoever is willing to sell it to them. They are clearly not going to be one of the first people to market with a self driving stack, so I think they should focus on what they do best, which is designing hardware and creating a great UX.](/r/stocks/comments/rchmjr/apples_selfdriving_car_project_loses_three_more/hnuv5yq/)

[&gt; Even if AAPL doesn't invent self driving, they will probably perfect the technology. Especially when they will have the bankroll to pay for talented teams and employees from other companies in the future.  Many in the industry have been working on self driving for well over 10 years and have yet to bring anything to market. It's not going to be simple for Apple to just ""perfect"" technology that no one has been able to get working yet. Apple hardly has a perfect record either, they have a lot of failures in their past.  imo I think there's an absurd amount of optimism baked into the Apple car by investors (given how much the news of it caused the stock to shoot up), even though it'll literally be at least until 2025 at a minimum before they bring in even a single dollar of revenue from it per Apple's own timeline. Google is a great company to, but they've been spending something like 15 years on their self driving vehicle, and their management seems to be losing faith in the project given how they're letting outside investors buy into Waymo, despite the fact that they have plenty of cash on hand available to pour into Waymo so that they can keep 100% of the profits for themselves.](/r/stocks/comments/rchmjr/apples_selfdriving_car_project_loses_three_more/hnuztsw/)

[Honestly best thing you can do right now if you're trading is focus on where the crowd is moving.  Watch for breakouts on themes/popular names.  We watched a rotation from TSLA/EVs to Metaverse stocks/NVDA/AMD/semis to AAPL (and other mega caps like MSFT roaring back the past few sessions) over the past 3 months.  Don't get married to an idea.  Just follow the big money/volume.  These breakout moves last for weeks.  Even AAPL looks like it has another week left in the tank (will re-evaluate after opex clears the gamma ramp a bit next week).  Most likely the next move will appear after the Fed meeting as the ""rotation to mega cap"" safety begins to end.

https://www.samsung.com/global/ir/financial-information/earnings-release/

TLDR - HIMX outlook seems mixed currently pending earnings call


WOT:  
Both companies guided a lower demand for TVs.  
Samsung phrasing out LCDs for QD.  
Revenue will be preserved due to margins (OLED for LG, QD for Samsung) the problem? Himx not in these tech.  

https://www.himax.com.tw/products/other-display-related-semiconductor-solutions/oled/

Smartphones and Tablets demand to remain strong but facing seasonality weakness.  
Honestly not what I wanted to hear, I expect to hear ""exponential"" or any similar strong words.

Monitors - Both companies basically said this is going to rekt faces lol. I hope HIMX does enjoy the benefits.

Automotives - Ford, Tsla, GM reported. Same issues semiconductors shortage.  
Mixed news here, Himx might be able to supply all the display drivers but cars are being bottle necked by other components resulting in less cars being produced  - implications on sales.  
Hopefully mercedes and jaguar and volkswagen has better news to announce.  

TCON solutions are nice but bundled with displays too.  
as for WiseEye, HIMX cant ship enough for it to matter despite management words of ""vigorous growth"" I still dont see any numbers, if u ship 0 at the start and ship 1000 next quarter u have an infinite gain so its technically ""vigorous growth"".  

I expect Q4 earnings to be average and for it to pick up at the mid part of the calendar year (when supply chain issues starts to ease up)  
Still bullish on a price increase tho, its undervalued given current numbers anyway relative to peers",positive

"[Well, my top 5 at this time are already in my portfolio…  1) GOOG - Absolutely dominant company that pretty much controls internet traffic. It has a moat that most will find hard to breach.  2) FB - Social media is too powerful today, and these guys run away from the competition in this department. I’ll be paying attention to the anti-trust battles, but until a competitor can legitimately challenge them, I’m not selling anything.  3) COST - In a world where e-commerce is overtaking traditional commerce, these guys aren’t going anywhere. Company is extremely well run, has a devoted fan base, and can increase their profits with the snap of a finger.  4) MSFT - Businesses run on Microsoft software. A few companies might switch, but all businesses? Unlikely.  5) V - Crypto may threaten them, but does anyone honestly believe that Visa is going anywhere in ten years? Credit and debit cards will still be used, and Visa will likely still be #1 or #2 in that department right alongside MasterCard.

MSFT: They not only have dividends but look at what deals they've been making this year. They signed a fat contract for VR headsets delivered to the Army. The military uses Microsoft's software for everything. Game pass on Xbox has been extremely successful. The Series X is actually competing with PlayStation this time around unlike the Xbox One. I truly believe MSFT is poised for more growth on top of maintaining their dominance in their sector.  MMM: 3M isn't a growth stock in my eyes, I'd hold them solely for the dividend simply put.  AMD: AMD, unlike Intel, doesn't have shitty leadership and is delivering in ways Intel can't. These last two years are indicative of that. Plus, they're very nice to run the options wheel on.

"&gt; Tesla has also had near constant reports of how toxic of a workplace it is along with sexual and racial lawsuits

On one occasion I recall, there was giant incentive for the 'victim' to exaggerate considering millions of dollars were at stake. See the [other side](https://www.tesla.com/blog/regarding-todays-jury-verdict) of the story for balance.

&gt; I work in an industry with a very strong union and incompetent employees are weeded out by the union, because they hurt the image of the union as a whole.

That's cool, and it slightly warms me to the idea. However, if a bunch of people aren't needed anymore because Tesla wants to move the branch elsewhere, there may be many more hurdles to jump through if the workers gang up on management. There's a definite conflict of interest there.

&gt; Corporations are not your friend and will work you dead if it means higher profits, unions give workers leverage

Tesla workers have been given the option to unionize, and they nevertheless prefer the free shares instead (they can't have both apparently). Not surprising considering TSLA has grown so incredibly over the past few years.",positive

[In a way, shareholders of PLTR enable this kind of equity compensation abuse by bidding up the price to speculative level. Whether PLTR decides to take advantage of this hype by raising cash by share issuance or by the silent killer of stock compensation is immaterial from a strict dilution point of view. I suspect that PLTR decides to go the stock compensation route is because they rightfully suspect that retail investors won't look too hard into their little scheme of paying employee by diluting shareholders, whereas a share issuance would create more news media attention, which would likely reach retail investors.   PLTR is a classic reminder of CISCO back in 2000 before the dotcom crash where equity compensation was rampant and investors back then didn't care because, the saying went, the company was changing the world and ""boomer"" investors just did not understand the company.](/r/stocks/comments/pipu1w/pltr_paying_themselves_first/hbrm387/)

MRNA is a super risky bet, they've got nothing but the Covid vaccine, and that's likely to dry up over the next year or two. After that it's anyone's guess what happens. They're working on a cancer vaccine and a super flu vaccine, if either work they could print money.   SQ is a good company, but they're struggling to turn a profit on $3b+ quarterly revenue while interest rates are super low. How will they do when interest rates start rising?  CRWD is a great company, one of the best in class, but their P/E is insane and they're unprofitable. Same with NET. They're gonna need years of growth to catch up to their valuations.   Can't speak enough to the rest, I haven't done my own research on them, but I've heard great things about them. ETSY is prob your safest bet but who knows.   The real question OP is how risk tolerant are you? There's a very good chance most will be flat or even down over the next year or two.

I don't know too much about alcoholic beverages though.   Are they also viable for small time investors or players?

&amp;#x200B;

Alcohol industry has been witnessing rampant demand at bars and restaurants, with the reopening of the on-premise channel. Meanwhile, the demand for alcohol in e-commerce portals and off-premise continues unabated. Companies are expected to benefit from the momentum in spirits and ready-to-drink (RTD) cocktails. Investments in product innovations and technology platforms bode well for players like Diageo Plc DEO, Constellation Brands Inc. STZ, Molson Coors Beverage Company TAP and The Duckhorn Portfolio NAPA.

Though the demand environment remains robust, companies are struggling to meet the demand due to the ongoing supply-chain disruptions, which have led to product shortages due to port congestion-related supply delays. Escalated input, freight and packaging costs along with higher advertising expenses may continue to be headwinds.",positive

"Recognize that this isn't him as a bear....that being said...

At this point Vitalik has much idea as to what market we are in or where pricing will go as the rest of us. None.

 Its all speculation and always will be regardless of adoption and/or maturity with crypto having even less fundamentals than the stock market....just look how speculative that market (stocks) has gotten - totally away from any meaningful association with most fundamentals.  Tesla a good yet extreme example (and not the only one).  Have I made a ton of money on TSLA?  For sure.  Was it speculation?  Totally.  Now that goodness or badness for tsla doest apply to ETH.  Tsla has capital now for investment.  If ETH goes up based on speculation there isn't a winner other than earlier investors....but a rising tide will raise the rest of the boats in terms of awareness and adoption.   We need more people a d institutions to become aware and normalize eth as an investment and a medium of exchange.  Speculation fuels that fire. 

 ETH is an  investment vehicle with interesting applications which will positively appreciate with adoption and security/maturity but pricing will always be at the whim of speculators like almost any  other tradeable market based investment / asset.  Traders and investors will always place their money based on how they see the importance of events and their own risk appetite.  Crypto probably even more so just by its very qualities and history.  It's shown not to be the security or inflation hedge we hoped and trades alongside sentiment of the rest of the markets.  I am super bullish on adoption and maturity of ETH especially but in a longer term horizion....looking at markets based on a week or a month and calling moonshots or winters is a waste of time. Buy and hold if you think it has a future.  Or day trade if you love casinos.  Do I think there is (big) money still to be made? 100. That's why I'm holding and still buying and mining.

"Yes, it's far more difficult than stocks; options are simple in comparison - just write calls 😀 

As to why, you can short a pair without ridiculous regulations, you can trade 24/5 and the profit potential is enormous.

If I buy $1000 in TSLA , that's less than 1 share, but lets round it to 1K. If it goes up 5%, that's $50. With leverage, I can make $50 in Forex from a .05 lot EURUSD (cost of $110-ish) moving 100 pips, which it can do in an hour, a day or a week. 

As for retirement income, check out QYLD or another dividend fund for nice, passive income. Don't risk your nest egg on Forex.

"Part of it comes down to how the rich had money then vs now. Then, if you owned steel mills or railroads or a shipping line, the money coming into your pockets was real cash. You didn’t want to be holding onto currency, so you’d buy land and expand your business and build palaces for yourself and maybe donate a bit too. It didn’t make sense to hoard this kind of wealth, as it would only deprecate in value, so you’d reinvest it in various concrete ways.

Now, the ultra-wealthy are so wealthy due to their paper wealth. Elon Musk gains and loses billions in a day not because the rate at which people are buying Tesla vehicles changes, but because people’s opinions about Tesla stock changes. Stocks have shifted into something like Pokémon cards - their value isn’t in the expectation that after X years they’ll have paid Y in dividends, their value is in the expectation that someone will eventually want to pay Z for the stock. 

It creates a different kind of ultra-wealthy. Sure, their paper value is enormous. But it’s also extremely fragile; Musk could be effectively ruined very quickly if people decide TSLA is severely overpriced. The old ultra-wealthy didn’t need to care if they the great masses didn’t see what was so great about owning all the railroads; the new ultra-wealthy are very dependent on the public continuing to believe that the stocks that the ultra-wealthy hold really are as valuable as they say they are.",positive
"Correct, that is the volatility that makes options so much trickier than shares. People OP sold those calls to are gambling not only on volatility staying high, but staying high bc the price moves in the right direction. 

You're not just factoring change of the underlying share price, but *rate of change*. Think back to math and physics, velocity is the derivative of position over time. Hence why options are known as derivatives.

If Google price had slowly and steadily climbed to 3k over months or years, the rate of change would be low, and Implied Volatility and therefore options premiums would reflect that. 

But Google hits 3k by jumping 10% in a single day? That means there's a higher likelihood of a further large move in either direction equally quickly.

How does one take advantage of this? Right now, both calls AND puts are expensive because of high IV triggered by the stock split news.. They are likely to drop in price soon due to volatility falling back down, since GOOG is typically not a volatile stock with massive daily swings, unlike say TSLA. 

So, rather than buying options, I'd recommend *selling* options on GOOG today, with the expectation that the share price won't change too drastically after today, IV will drop, the options you sold would become cheaper and you can buy them back for less down the road. 

For example, you could sell both a single call and a put for Google at $3000 expiring Feb 18, and get paid a total of ~$14.6k for both. If by Feb 18 GOOG s under 2850 or over 3150, you'll end up losing money. The closer to 3000 that GOOG ends up at the more of that $14.6k you get to keep as profit.",positive

"People in this thread (and probably in general) don't understand ""net worth"".  They also don't understand that everytime Elon sold stock to pay taxes on his options, the price of TSLA stock went down.

"This is why I don’t understand the consternation by some that there’s “no way” that VW and TSLA won’t be neck-and-neck in EV production around 2025.    

VW group is HUGE compared to TSLA (measured by production volume).  It has enormous global production capacity as well as the broad engineering capability and deep supply chains where model and factory changeovers are routine.

It’s not magic, it’s math.   If VW can keep transitioning EV production at the current tempo it will be a horse race by the end of 2025.

This is good for all of us.",positive
"
I don’t know. The dividend language is the same that TSLA used for their 5:1 split in 2020. It’s just a split at the end of the day. 

Brokers will just adjust the short position to reflect the split. For a 7:1 split, shorts would go from one IOU at current prices to seven IOUs at a lesser price. 

We are not gaining value here. Nothing fundamentally changes. If you invested $1000 pre-split, you would still have $1000 invested post split. Any gains would be from people buying in anticipation of the price rising. I believe share holders would need to gain value from the dividend to force pressure on shorts. 

This includes synthetic shares. Those are “legit” trades on the brokers books. That’s what makes it so fucked up. Naked shorting (and shorting in general) skews supply/demand by artificially inflating supply without changing demand. Brokers won’t try to sort what’s real or fake, they will just do simple math to balance the books.

Those shorts are not tied to any specific share. Shorts could make a killing if we didn’t adjust their position. Here’s a scenario. A short owes the broker 1 share that they sold at say $200. GME splits 7:1 and their position wasn’t adjusted. They can now buy 1 share of GME for ~$28.50 to close their position. Netting them $200-28.50 = $171.50 in profit (minus fees). Obviously that’s not how this will work. Brokers have to adjust the position. 

Or are you saying their one shorted share will adjust to $28.50 and they will owe $28.50*6 to make up for the dividend? Because that still doesn’t make sense nor does it really hurt shorts.

I just don’t think that’s how this works. 

So why the fuck would GameStop want this? I think it’s because it has been a successful strategy to increase shareholder value. Folks will invest based on stock price alone (not market cap) and it makes the option market more accessible.

I think it’s also a unique way to deal with shit analysts that say GME is worth less than $80 per share. Analyst price estimates will need to be adjusted with the split too. They can’t say GME going to $40 anymore. After a 7:1 split, they will have to say GME is going to $5. And that’s just funny.",positive

https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/attachments/1635541217775-png.727253/

If you had 25% of your 401k, or IRA, or even an over the counter retail stock account in TSLA and TSLA went up 26x then what was 25% of your savings just became 98% of your savings.

You could sell off some but you'd miss out on gains to come, better bet if you want diversification is to buy more of something else as you add to your account over time, but if Tesla keeps going up faster than you invest it's going to stay in that 90-99% range.

Over long time series, value has outperformed growth because of reversion to the mean - not just in multiples but even in underlying business dynamics. Today's fast-growing companies often are tomorrow's laggards, and the other way around. Who bought MSFT 10 years ago? The value investors!

[TSLA has that covered with their approach.  Battery storage systems (Powerwall) powering your home, charged by solar, also charging your vehicle.  You can set to only drip off the grid at night or total off peak hours for cost savings if you want to 100% top off before storms or higher than expected usage.  Issue is the cost investment.  Way out of most consumer price ranges.  Subsides only help so much.](/r/stocks/comments/pz4fx4/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_oct/heyvaqw/)

[TSLA Powerwall is just that - battery powered ""generator"" allowing people to either go fully off-grid with solar, or reduce dependence on grid with partial solar.  The Powerwall battery units are sold from 1 unit (near $10K) to 10+ units (near $75K) and extend time for days fully off grid, depending on needs and charging methods.  Can get anywhere from 1-2 days to 30 days depending on config.  They're usually combined with solar panels (average in my area is $35K) or the newer and much sleeker looking solar roof (easily $200K+ after incentives).  Prices need to plummet for more consumers to buy these, or incentives need to be offered.  Spending more on off-grid solar with battery power system than a house is worth makes little sense financially.](/r/stocks/comments/pz4fx4/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_oct/heziyws/)

[I disagree. I think that one of the reasons that FB is so screwed right now is the reason you allude to -- lots of competition for that sort of casual social media content that you find on platforms like FB Insta Tiktok and SNAP. So yes there is definitely competition but I think twitter exists in a slightly different niche.   Also, I think that it will be interesting to see what they do w/ Twitter Spaces and integrating payments into the platform. Not sure how actively you follow fintwit but theres a ton of people who offer exclusive ""paid"" twitter feeds but they currently all of those subscriptions are handled off platform via 3rd party. The fact this is happening is clear evidence that the product market fit is there and twitter just needs to integrate payment functions (which they have plans to do) to capture that.   I'm not saying they are going to do anything out of this world amazing, but the notion that they are not adding features and thinking about their revenue models is just objectively incorrect. They have a large platform that they are basically just starting to try and monetize......we will just have to wait and see but i'm long a small bit of TWTR.](/r/stocks/comments/so8wl8/twtr_is_such_a_fail/hwarbld/)

"[Traditionally brokers charged 2.8+2.8=5.6٪  but with the market going crazy 2.5+2.5=5% has been more customary in the Denver market, can't speak to other markets.  Also, a lot of brokers, myself included will only charge a seller 1.0+2.8=3.8% if they are wanting to buy another house in the same market, so it really could be cheaper to work with a broker.    However it is a huge hassle to sell your house, getting it show ready, people come through non stop without notice, also sometimes deals fall through. They also make great money on the repairs they charge the home owner for, this might actually be the big money maker for them, like it is for property management companies. There is value in what OPEN does, quick guaranteed close, so people will still want it, but it won't ever take more than a 4-5% market share.  A person's home is typically their largest investment and to think the majority of home owners would leave an extra 10-15% on the table isn't realistic.  Also, I'm starting to do marketing next month where I guarantee I'll sell your house for 5k more than your opendoor offer or I'll pay you 5k.  Other brokers probably will too, but this won't hurt OPEN numbers anytime soon, but might long term.  For OPEN to succeed they need their customers to fail.

If it doesn't reach that, then yeah, probably just keep holding. This is subject to change pending outlook of intel, global markets, etc.  My reasoning is that I believe that INTC is quite undervalued here. The leaps have more upside than shares here in the short term. This is especially true with the really low IV - leaps are incredibly cheap. This also means that a little movement against me can wreck a large % (as seen here). As long as my investment thesis didn't change, I am not selling.

"So well written and I'm so glad this sub isn't some cultfest like /r/bitcoin is. I'd argue a lot of people (not most) will be well off with or without crypto. I think I'm already well off in my 30s not counting my crypto assets--so just working a job, saving money, investing it, I've already done well for myself.

You're right, I don't think it's anyone's job to change another's outlook on finances.

More to the OP, but in a more serious realistic view on things, when you're young, you can make YOLO bets on crypto. When you're 40 or 50, you're more focused on making sure you have enough to retire on at 65 and preserving your wealth. It's why general financial advice has people ramp down on risk at an older age. The fact that someone middle-aged views Crypto as risky isn't surprising at all. Even in my 20s I saw crypto as risky. It's highly volatile. Could you make millions potentially? Yeah, but you could've also off of TSLA, AAPL, GME, AMC, etc. If it was a guaranteed path to success, everyone would be rich already. There's a reason why we have general safe advice that works for 99.9% of people and why 401ks and IRAs lead you to target date retirement funds-its because statistically speaking you could not know a thing about finance and still come out with a hefty balance over 30 years--and that's what risk is. You have a chance at being a millionaire or billionaire with crypto, but you also have a high chance of that $100 going to $0 with many coins.

[If you don't believe this is true, you haven't done any research in this market. There's a reason why VW called a crisis meeting with the 200 most highly placed managers a week ago. Tesla is making cars 3 times as fast (and consequently at a much lower price) as their newest, state-of-the-art ID3 plant. They know they're going out of business if something doesn't change fast.  Legacy automakers have tons of debt with ICE vehicles as collateral, whose worth will depreciate massively as people start to realize how expensive an ICE vehicle is to own compared to an EV. For example, I calculated the costs for my next car, and it's about €4.000 cheaper for me to drive a used Model 3 (purchase price €42.500) for 5 years than a second-hand ICE car (purchase price €10.000).  Legacy automakers have simply been asleep at the wheel, and now they don't have the balance sheet to make it through multiple years of being unprofitable by transitioning to EVs, while Tesla is pushing them out of the market selling highly profitable EVs.  Like /u/carsonthecarsinogen said above, Mercedes will be around (they're actually moving fast), VW will probably still be around (although they'll have nowhere near their current 12,5% market share), but many are going bankrupt (GM, BMW, Toyota (the automotive department, not the greater company) to name a few certain ones).](/r/stocks/comments/q5kk1r/if_you_had_to_choose_one_stock_between_tsla_and/hg7km4h/)

I have been following TSLA every since I bought shares at $42 onwards, know the company in details. Unfortunately, I am not so rich to put my savings into TSLA to gain a lot.

[A company that cannot make money with their products is never too big to fail. There's no point bailing a company out if it has no path to profitability. It will just go bankrupt again the next year. Especially when all of these workers could be working at Tesla (or Amazon for that matter) and actually be earning money for the American economy.  On top of that, once the inevitability of declining earnings due to the exponential increase in EV sales and decline in ICE sales will start catching up to Ford/GM, their lobby over the government will start to decline.](/r/stocks/comments/q5kk1r/if_you_had_to_choose_one_stock_between_tsla_and/hg8gpfk/)

"I had three stocks pre-pandemic: Ford, 3M, and Verizon. Those were companies I used and were somewhat familiar with. Built up something modest but then the Pandemic happened and suddenly I had huge influxes of cash from overtime at work and stimulus checks while also not having to commute or have other big expenses. I pretty much could buy any stock I wanted and it would go up. FUN, TSLA, etc. Made a lot of money and then Gamestop happened and had a strong addiction to the market form. Made a lot of money, paid off credit cards and had enough for taxes next year when I have to file, but I doubled down on Sundial because of a certain subreddit I had subscribed to during Gamestop preaching to buy the dip. I lost 2,000 dollars on buying a dip that never turned around.

Someone in that subreddit bashed index funds and other options that weren't extremely volatile and I had no idea what Indexing was so I felt the need to learn more and why they disliked it so much. I listened to Bogle in an interview and just became enchanted with the idea of a lower risk option that really toned down the feelings of gambling in the market. Dollar cost averaging and things sounded great.

Doing more research, I found my 401k plan drastically underperformed the total market and basically every other index I could find. So I made that my first change, copying a total market with what indexes I had available in the plan. I changed my HSA to an admiral index fund. I picked up a Roth IRA for a total market fund too.

[Nvidia mixes their gaming and crypto sales together and have basically been misreporting their earnings that way for a while now. So that’ll reflect poorly in oncoming earnings.   With ETH moving to POS, graphics power isn’t needed. And with the extreme fear in the crypto markets, miners for other coins like BTC are going to sell rigs in an effort to gain back capital and park it for later (mining may not be as profitable if coins continue to keep going down as they have over the past months). This floods the market with used cards, as we saw in 2018. Takes sales from manufacturers.   Nvidia is also facing increasing competition from AMD, recently lost the ARM deal, and supply chain issues in regards to silicon. With a global shortage, they’ll need voodoo magic to navigate a potentially oncoming recession without bleeding badly.   And ofc, there’s Apple. The M series chips are a threat to graphic card manufacturers as a whole. Mac users no longer have a need to buy GPUs from third party vendors. Windows and Linux become the only markets Nvidia and AMD can operate in, and with the rising trend of the younger generations who will enter the workforce in the future, Apple will gain a significant dominance over the future workforce generations. Mac preferability is growing, with Apple taking more marketshare from high-end users and Google chromebooks from the low-end.   Most younger generations use exclusively Apple products, and once they bring their Apple device favorability to the professional markets, Nvidia will be forced to focus on servers and data centers, as well as AI and autonomous vehicle ventures. With increasing regulatory concern regarding autonomous vehicles, there may be some scrutiny and potential roadblocks there too.](/r/stocks/comments/vc0izd/now_that_stocks_are_having_a_summer_sale_what_are/icbqybl/)

[Why focus on just NVIDIA? Tech in general has been hysterical. Elon Musk sells a shoddy car and lies about ""robot taxis"" and full self driving and became the richest man in the world over it. At least NVIDIA makes things of merit. No one can match them on the GPU front, while any car maker can make a great EV.  Tech itself has dumped, not just NVIDIA. AMD's 6 month is down 34% to NVIDIA 43%. Old guards like MSFT are down 25%. Reddit goldenboy and product of ""genius"" Elon Musk, Tesla, is down 50% from its recent high.  Not to mention NVIDIA's chips are used in AI and machine learning, so its not even graphics anymore, but the core technology that is leading, potentially, one of the most important innovations in human history.

He thought it was ready to save America immediately. Solar panels -Obama went to my neighborhood to promote a made in USA latest tech panels using Feds grant. After he came back it went out of business. Can not compete with Chinese low tech panels.  There are also a lot of crooks promoting something that they have not even got it working-Nikola being one.    If you do you invest in top companies that actually has  produced a lot eVs like Tsla. Nio which is struggling like everyone else. If the Chinese can not do it you know other countries will not likely be successful.   Keep in mind you do not invest in a company that does not have solid earning, profitability, and growth or you will be disappointed.  I listen to Bloomburg, CNBC now and then.

I wonder how much variance comes from a stock like TSLA making it's wild ride from small cap to one of the largest S&amp;P500 holdings. All those index funds are not just going out on the open market to place a buy order when TSLA crosses their thresholds for entry.,positive
TSLA is opening a new giga Fab to address chip shortage. Vertically integrated to the max. Next they will make their own litho and processing tools.,positive
"Meanwhile TSLA will probably break $950 in the same time frame, and F will likely just take a dump and sit around $12 in two months.

Lesson one in the markets - everything is an advertisement to get you to buy a piece of crap. The whole NYSE and NASDAQ are all used cars, more than used, they're like those totalled cars that are rebuilt from accidents then sold as ""new"".

I'm not saying your F trade will cost you big bucks or be ruinous, but watch it, see how it actually performs in 2 months versus your expectations. Sometimes the ""ads"" are good bets, sometimes they're lemons, just like looking for classic cars that need a little work.

My bet is that F is getting pumped right now on Lightning and EV craze and will just kinda...flounder a little. Maybe sideways. Maybe gain a point.

$12 is a little extreme downside lol.",positive

"Hey 32no, 

Excellent points,

Yea, that's roughly in line with the nasdaq's projections. I don't disagree that its an amazing company and it's growing into its earnings, but value is in the eye of the beholder. I personally don't assign a value larger than all of the major auto manufacturers combined, but the market doesn't give a rats ass where I see value ;-)...It is the institutions that matter. I am hoping that they continue to see value, otherwise we will have a lead balloon the size of the energy sector attached to every American's 401k. So, I am hoping that double edged sword that I mentioned, tilts in favor of TSLA. 

You have to admit there is a lot of air in that volume profile right??

I mean absolutely no disrespect, but if you were to draw support lines, where would you draw them? Would they line up with mine or would they be different? If we broke support, what would the next level of support be? If you are new to the sub... I actually ask questions out of respect. I have my own opinion,but I believe there is never harm in challenging our own opinion.

"[Days like today can be big days. Here's how I trade them.   Quick caveat first. I don't use scanners or anything and only use RSI, volume and price action.   I trade the same stocks everyday. Group 1: AMD, AAPL, SPY, QQQ, FB and some occasionally Group2: TSLA, CRM, MSFT and NVDA.   This morning I had high conviction it was going to sell off after the pop up.   The value of trading the same stocks is you get to know them.   Starting this year, I noticed my group 1 stocks will take a run right before open. And the RSI will go over sold on on the 15 minute timeframe. Then it'd push at open them sell off all day.   So now when this happens I look to take a short position.   The run up is likely shorts getting out versus long buying. Shorts take profits, trap retail traders then downtrend all day.   The same is true if the 15 minute goes oversold.   ***AMD has been selling off even when when oversold so of you back test ignore AMD doe past week.   To recap Look for Group 1 stocks to be oversold at open on 15 minute timeframe.  Let run up at open. On one minute candle look for any reversal candles and a higher low.

[I trade FB everyday. I only trade the same few stocks everyday - AAPL, AMD, FB, spy, QQQ.   So I can see why you thought it was going lower.   However, look at the early high green candle on the 5 minute.  If you draw a trend line to the next high red candle, you'll see it broke above.   And if you notice FB broke higher then the lowest low in first 15 mins.   Historically, these are signs of strength.

[Forget about flags, penates, stars, clouds etc.   You are overcomplicating trading.   Daily: FB is in a down trend, so you should have short bias.   Daily Levels: S 210.38 and R 219.58  So the idea here is to see what FB will do at the 219.58 daily level. Since you are bearish on FB, you are looking for the stock go up and test that level (which it did). At which point you want to see it bounce off that level and start it's downward descent.   FB breaks the 219.58 level but is unable to really push through it. It consolidates for about 20 minutes.   You want to wait for confirmation of the rejection. A few nice bodied LLs. It was pretty apparent at 10:35am that it was holing and dropping.   That is when you enter short.   You entered short after the move down and when it was on a rally back to the daily level of 219.58.   If you missed the first move I outlined, then your next play would have been to wait to see what it does on the retest.   The next entry signal was at 1:50pm. Although it does make a pull back right after that, so depending on your stop and risk tolerance, you would have either been stopped out or rode out the pullback and consolidation for the nice drop down to 216.06 price.](/r/Daytrading/comments/u1mete/was_this_15_minute_flag_a_good_trade/i4j3y6p/)

"[TSLA is breaking out it seems. It’s expensive though to get the lower strikes.    One approach is to use call spreads to gain access to the lower strikes without paying $6k a piece or whatever.    I went with 800 strike for Dec and Jan. I am looking at some $1000-1200ish ones for Dec 2022.    Next is spy. Daily calls. Just pure gambling basically but the daily opens low typically and spikes up. Just sell. Or at least sell most. Don’t go for a banger. You see it on wsb but for every guy who gets 400% spy daily there has to be 50,000+ losers. So if you get 50%, just fucking sell. 50% in a single day is godly.    I keenin mind that if you roll 50k at 30% 12x is $1m. I recently started doing this a couple weeks ago with a separate account. Didn’t work once. Didn’t do every day. Has worked about 5-7 days or so. Started with 50k and it’s at about 200k now. Gets scarier putting all 200k into spy though. So I’ve been timid. Trying to hit 10m by end of year.    Other thing is called in my head tech 30 day earnings ramp. Lots of good co not just tech rise 30d pre earnings. You buy about that time and target just barely OTM. Not trying to hit home runs just the solid 50% range.    As earnings approach the stock usually ramps up. Sell before earnings. Don’t hold for earnings. If you like the stock for whatever reason. Sell. Take your money. Wait for earnings. Then buy shares. You might miss a rise but it’s unpredictable.    I have 235 visa calls as well. Same thing. Ramp to earnings.    Where IV has exploded and the stock has been going up quite a bit from where it was, consider iron condors. IC’s with high IV have the unique gift of making the spread (of profitability) much larger. This improves your return % dramatically. I did it on a few. Most notably on OSTK. IV gave me a huge spread of break even profit. I bet pretty heavily. It is stressful because the pricing isn’t perfectly logical but as the day comes to a  close it evens out. Don’t hold to expiry. Just get out. Factor this in when you choose your entering strikes. This is the only time I hold for earnings.    Love iron condors quite a bit. Just used a lot of collateral.    If I don’t know what to do and don’t see anything I love I don’t do any calls. Instead I’ll just find solid names and if they’re down for no good reason buy shares with max leverage. The other week for example    Adobe msft fb all down for no reason at one point or another.   With leverage margin you get a decent return for the day. I usually sell end of day. But if I can snap up one of those and buy 10,000 shares or something, goes up $1-3, that’s $30 fucking thousand.

[“In the option money”… I think this is where I get confused.   So if TSLA is $700 and I think it should really be $750, I buy calls with a certain date in the future and wait for it to hit $750. If it never hits $750 and the date comes and goes, I lose it all. If it does hit $750, or over, I make some money. Is that correct?  I don’t understand why the buy for 100x TSLA at $700 is a certain amount. It seems a fraction of the actual value.

"LMAO the first paragraph is hilarious, complete, utter, absolute fiction and the second isn’t far behind.

Lucid? Vaporware? $180k? *They started production bro-ham.* Unlike Tesla they let independent mags verify their EPA range figures on an actual preproduction car. The only $180k variant (actually $161k…but whatever) is the overkill launch edition, the rest are competitively priced with the Model S. The battery’s big but only like 10% bigger than the Model S (which is…somehow a bad thing...?) Like what reality do you live in? Or do you just spread lies to try and pump TSLA?

Re: the rest….like….man idk what to tell you. Every EV out there besides the Leaf has much the same-ish sort of BMS with liquid cooling as Tesla does. The driver assist stuff is common across the industry in ICE and electrics. Efficiency is a whole other ballgame since EPA ratings are horrifically inaccurate for many EV’s. Anecdotally mine’s supposed to be less efficient than a 3 SR+ but I very easily get more or less the same efficiency and more range since the battery’s bigger.

The only points you made in that whole rant that have any credibility are the UI reference and the performance - Tesla’s UI is pretty slick and that’s something I liked about it. Problem is, **everything** is buried in the screen, which is something I hated about it. And the acceleration is definitely a “pro” in the pros and cons list, but I’m not dropping $50k on a car that’s missing the features I want. I live in a warm area and use the ventilated seats like 5 times per week at least, whereas I need to hit 60 in less than 5 seconds like 0.001% of the time I’m driving.

Anyway…this was fun but I be done since this ain’t going anywhere. Truly wish the best for Tesla and TSLA.",positive

More likely to have the wherewithal to weather the storm, and in fact, may have an improved competitive position after the recession is over.

First of all, I've seen YouTubers talking about reduced revenue from ads, meaning less companies are advertising with Google, and indeed their ad revenue dropped in Q4. I think it will happen again and will probably continue since companies are probably trying to save money now that the printer is off.  In Q4 Apple announced that it was slowing down production of iPhones and I think in Q1 they said the same thing.

Maybe drop MSFT to 15% and AMZN to 10% then put a little more into some other big tech names (GOOG or AAPL ideally) or a tech ETF if you want to maintain high tech exposure.

[For the sake of the discussion, I'll make an argument generally against mega caps &amp; market-cap weighted indices like the S&amp;P500...  Over the last couple of decades the largest companies the US indexes have massively benefited from the growth of large, multinational software companies. Some of these companies are now so large that you can measure their revenues as a percentage of US GDP. This is a concern because the S&amp;P500 is basically just a collection of the largest 500 companies listed in the US, it's not necessarily a bet on the US economy as many people think. For example, it's theoretically possible that GDP in the US could grow while the largest companies in the US could see their earnings decline. The reverse is also true.  Today the only reason companies like AAPL, GOOG, MSFT and AMZN can sustain their huge revenues because of their international exposure. If over the next decade the world becomes less globalised while economic areas such as Europe continue to tighten their regulation against US tech it's quite possible we'll see the S&amp;P500 and mega caps underperform while international &amp; small-cap stocks outperform.  IMO the primary risk for mega caps is there level of international exposure. Today it's become quite easy to imagine a scenario where the CCP decides to support domestic phone manufactures by blocking the sell of Apple / Android devices, while Europe continues to regulate Apple and Google's ecosystems. You can see how this might hurt their bottom lines even if the US economy continues to grow at a healthy pace. And given the weighting of tech in the major indexes these types of headwinds could present a significant drag on the returns of US indices over the next decade should they play out.  I'm not personally looking to increase my portfolio weighting to international &amp; small-cap stocks just yet given large caps are probably more defensive for the time being given economic uncertainties, but going forward I do play to allocate more to small caps because I don't think the world will tolerate US tech companies become ever more dominant and exerting ever more social and political influence forever. Arguably we're starting to see signs of this today with various countries blocking US social media and Europe continuing to tighten their regulation on US tech companies, and I expect this trend will only accelerate in the years to come.](/r/stocks/comments/u7gfwb/why_are_people_so_confident_in_megacap_stocks/i5em2db/)

AAPL is for sale at 10% off now due to the China covid shutdowns but  turns out Apple is so good at managing these kinds of things now that it only affected them for about a week, and they can make up a week's production within a month. So any loss of sales this Q gets quickly replaced for next quarter.  I also consider GOOGL, FB and AMZN greedy ands elfish to not pay dividends. I never trust a company awash in cash which wont give back to their shareholders or even have stock buybacks.   AMZN also has some serious problems now with inflation and unions, and FB and GOOGL are the two mostly likely to be hit with regulatory measures, plus ongoing resistance from Apple to allow datamining on IOS.](/r/stocks/comments/u7ed5p/your_top_stocks_in_your_watchlist/i5hbtds/)

"It's hard to work out given volatility, but its pretty straightforward to work out if you assume linear growth up or down. For example, 3TSL in £ is currently £0.74. If we pretend that over the next 30 days TSLA will return to $1200, then that implies a growth per day of 2.06% for TSLA. So for 3x that will roughly be 2.06% \* 3, or +6.18% a day.

So the formula I use is:

    c * (1 + (g * 3)) ^ n
    
    c = current 3x price
    g = underlying gain per day 
    n = number of days

So for in this scenario that's

    £0.74 * (1 + (2.06 * 3)) ^ 30 = £4.48

So 3x would be worth roughly £4.48 at $1200 from today's price (or a gain of &gt;500%).

Short % of Shares Outstanding (Jul 30, 2021)  **3.11%**

PLTR is not a heavily shorted stock, with only just over 3% of the total shorted.  This is nowhere near GME territory early this year (greater than 100% shorted) or even TSLA territory (I believe about 25-30% of TSLA was shorted prior to the stock being included in   
 the S&amp;P500). 

Trading Volume was over 60 Million shares today.  Anyone who shorted the stock can easily cover without having much upwards effect on share price

Short sellers are unlikely to target PLTR, because Palantir's business has no realistic chance of bankruptcy anytime soon. 

Palantir has 2.4 Billion in cash/equivalents on hand, zero debt, and generates free cash flow from its business operations (over $139 Million in Q2 '21).   The company's finances are extremely strong.

Rent is not much better; any living space starts at $1k and every apartment I've seen is going for $1,700.00.  A single person can scrape by living in some efficiency the size of a prison cell ($900/month), and maybe after you've spent your money on only your necessities (food/water/electricity) maybe you have some money to save. But your still fucked because house prices rise so quickly, you'll never have a chance.  Unless you can enjoy living with no privacy, no living space, no dignity, no fun, and no means to own a Home then forget about living an enjoyable fulfilling life.](/r/stocks/comments/rag88b/the_greatest_wealth_transfer_in_history/hnlziyq/)

[It's not a high number though. Not every country treats diabetes in animals as an active problem - the truth is they let the animal die, even in developed countries.  The OP addresses that ""vets are desperate to control diabetes"" but the only good solution to this is actively have humans take glucose readings and administer insulin to their pets as needed or on a highly regulated schedule. Insulin for pets isn't THAT expensive, and there are many brands to choose from that are \*almost\* interchangeable for pets. Cats are the only exception as they can only tolerate some currently available insulin, but cat owners that can't afford the specific insulin (around me is about $250/month out of pocket expense) sure as hell aren't going to be able to afford a wearable device for their cat. \*Just for reference, the most common insulin my clinic prescribes is $25 a month through Walmart\*  As another person mentioned, how are these even supposed to stay on the pet? Do you shave the animal each time to reapply a new one, how do you pick a spot that wont get the monitor/injector bumped, licked or chewed off? This is asinine.  If you have a chill enough pet to 1) shave to apply the new monitor/pump and 2) apply the monitor/pump to and they ACTUALLY LEAVE IT ALONE then you very well could go the ""tried and true"" route of checking blood glucose levels yourself and administering insulin.  If Libre is being used off-label (also begs the question as to what happens when it fails, does the Vet get sued by the client for using it on their animal) then there's ""already"" a product in use for this application, so I don't expect much push to be the ""first"" company for such a niche product.  I liken this product akin to the ""fitness trackers"" you can put on your pet's collar to monitor their physical activity. A cool concept but won't be widely put into use.](/r/pennystocks/comments/rbvhd8/alrt_why_they_will_go_from_05_to_50_in_the_next_6/hnre6vo/)

But all of this comes at a cost. If Robinhood loses its revenue stream they will have to charge commissions. But so will Webull and all of the other free commission brokers.

* Musk exceeds the 5% threshold for SEC disclosure but continues buying without disclosing. (late disclosure added ~$150M to his profit)
* Musk disclosed his stake, Twitter shares rose 27% to $50/share.
* Musk offers buyout, shares soared 18% in pre-market trading.
* YOU ARE HERE

&gt;All of this while being forbidden by the SEC to make any comment that appears to be market related.

&gt;But I don't think he will resell his stocks. He really wants to buy Twitter, because he has recognized that Twitter is an excellent platform to manipulate stocks and cryptos.

"This is a good question and I think you'll find that there are a variety of answers, some contradictory.

My method is to treat trades the same way the IRS does, which makes for easier tax preparation. The close that is part of a roll creates taxable events, so I consider that old trade as an independent P/L from the new trade. I don't try to combine them.

So if I start with spread A and 12 days later roll to spread B, A is a **realized** gain/loss and B is yet to be determined. The cost basis of A was the opening debit/credit. The cost basis for B is also it's independent opening debit/credit, with nothing carried over from A.

This is aligned with my philosophy that *no single trade is important*. What matters is the average of a large volume of trades where I've arranged for each to have positive expected value. If you do that, on average and over  a sufficiently long period of time, you will be a profitable trader. So to me, rolling A into B is no different from opening a call on TSLA one week and opening a call on AAPL two weeks later. You wouldn't connect those in your head, so why connect the roll?

"&gt; You don’t tank a trillion dollar S&amp;P 500 company held by most institutions without some revenge

Do you not understand that Elon and Tesla are already at war?  The 1.2T bill that just passed had $150B earmarked as subsidies for Tesla's competitors, in order that they would be able to enter markets that Tesla has pioneered and where Tesla is already profitable without subsidy.

The SEC regulates Elon to the point of muzzling him, yet lets egregious violations go when committed by companies that have a 100 year history of campaign finance donations/violations.

Unions have a great deal of political clout and Elon has consistently defied and defeated the UAW.   

Elon's current actions are hitting back the only way he can.  Those same institutions you mention, large holders of TSLA who have profited handsomely, also have political clout and Elon is warning them that if they don't wake up and take his case to their cronies, he is capable of smacking them in the face.",positive

"[Excellent summary of MSFT.   My only counter argument is that most of what you listed is well established. MSFT has not a lot of room to grow as far as windows, office, &amp; Xbox.  I’m not familiar with the gaming subs, but if you have to have it to use your Xbox, it’s a great recurring revenue stream, but I question the opportunity for growth.   As far as Azure, I think there is a significant opportunity there. I know every company I’ve ever worked for needs to switch to Azure, and none have yet. I suspect that’s true for many companies. Now as to the growth potential on that front, I would even know how to begin to quantify that.   As far as GOOGL, I think they have to ability to monetize a lot more than they do currently. They have us by the balls, and they ratchet the price WAY up before people begin to try to find an alternative. They also have a quantum computer that will be coming around soon. We won’t all have one, but companies will be buying time on it for a pretty penny. They are top 5 in mobile devices, and will be top 3 before long.

"It seems you're not really aware of what Tesla actually does as a company. I've added notes which I hope will help.

&gt;Autonomous driving- Tesla is way behind competitors like Waymo or Mobileye.

I would like to know what metrics you use to come to that conclusion. Given how different the systems are, and how very different their deployments are, I doubt anybody could say that with confidence.

Waymo is really quite limited. Only operating in very specific, heavily mapped, and curated areas. Generally areas without harsh weather, or very high density. To get a ride you need to be in the ""Trusted Tester program"" and they are doing limited travel. In SF they only drive [100,000 miles per week](https://mobile.twitter.com/TechTekedra/status/1426339194767507459).

Even so Waymo has the [highest ratio of crashes](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/waymo-tops-nhtsas-list-of-autonomous-vehicle-crashes) of any autonomous driving system.

How do you manage to get ""Waymo is ahead"" from this?

I have no doubt Google, a heavyweight in the AI space, will build a capable autonomous system. I just don't see any proof to the claim that they are currently ahead.

Waymo is a a relatively small group and certainly not at the level of Tesla who have more engineers, more real world data, they build the software down to the compiler level and design and build all the hardware from the inferencing computers on board to the backend training systems. All of which is completely custom from the ground up.

&gt;Tesla is now backtracking on on the use of LIDAR

There are no plans to use LIDAR. You might be confused because you saw a picture of a Tesla with a LIDAR system mounted on the roof? That could be Tesla gathering data for training. It could be nothing at all. We just don't know. All we know for sure is there are zero plans to use LIDAR.

Or you might be confused between LIDAR and high-res rader?

""A very high resolution radar would be better than pure vision, but such a radar does not exist. I mean vision with high res radar would be better than pure vision."" -- Musk, 2022.

They then built such a radar and [registered it with the FCC](https://apps.fcc.gov/eas/GetApplicationAttachment.html?id=5932636). But that doesn't mean it will feature on Tesla cars and no such announcement has been made.

I expect if Tesla discovered any means of making their system better they would pursue that avenue. They just have not made any announcements at all about adding LIDAR or radar to their cars.

&gt;Battery tech- Tesla uses Panasonic to manufacture their batteries, and I don’t see any groundbreaking innovations in battery chemistry from Tesla

Panasonic is a manufacturing partner (as Samsung will become). They makes the cells. Tesla invents the chemistry and holds multiple [patents](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Tesla-s-strength-in-patent-numbers-leaves-rivals-in-dust) including on [advanced battery chemistry](https://patents.justia.com/patent/10784530). They also have patents on [packs](https://patents.google.com/patent/US7671565B2/en), [new cell chemistry](https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielcohen/2020/12/30/teslas-new-lithium-ion-patent-brings-company-closer-to-promised-1-million-mile-battery/?sh=9c01c2533e39), [cell manufacturing](https://patents.justia.com/patent/11367864), [battery fault detection](https://patents.justia.com/patent/11190031), [conditioning and testing of batteries](https://patents.justia.com/patent/11218045), [battery safety](https://patents.justia.com/patent/10780767) and the list just goes on and on. The latest related patent was ""Sintered cathode active material elements"" related to their inhouse 4680 cells.

This is why Tesla batteries are the highest energy density cells available in volume production at 260 Wh/kg. And why their new cells can give you 270 miles of range with [less than an hour of charging](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-y-texas-4680-battery-charges-0-97-under-1-hour-video/).

So when you say ""I don't see any groundbreaking innovations in battery chemistry from Telsa"" do you think it is because you aren't looking?

None of this is to say others aren't doing amazing work in the battery space. They are. It's just that you are underselling Tesla's long history of achievements. 

&gt;Profitability 

Yes, Tesla's margin of 13.1% higher traditional automakers. According to [some analysts](https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/04/25/heres-the-secret-behind-teslas-industry-leading-ma) that is  down to; high upfront prices and high demand, vertical integration, operational efficiency, and zero advertising spend also helps.

Also note that much of the FSD sales were [deferred revenue](https://wccftech.com/tesla-has-unlocked-substantial-deferred-revenue-recognition-by-expanding-its-fsd-beta-to-100000-additional-users/) though, and only this year has Tesla been able to recognize any of it thanks to the expanded FSD beta program. Even so it is a very small amount compared to overall revenue - [$3b total](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2022/01/minimum-tesla-fsd-financial-impacts-in-2022.html) vs $17.72b for just Q4 '21 revenue.

&gt;Elon’s constant pumping of Tesla stock by hyping it

“Tesla stock price is too high imo” -- Musk, 2020.

&gt; then using that to pay off debts also helps.

Paying off your debts isn't a bad thing.

Tesla is clearly very profitable and revenue has been [reliably rising each year](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/revenue). This isn't an accounting trick.

&gt;Demand and brand value- this has always been Tesla’s strongest point. Loyal customers who will ask ‘how much?’ when Elon says ‘pay me money’. 

Demand remains extremely strong. They sell every single car they make. There are millions of pre-orders for the yet to be released Cybertruck. The cars are so highly valued that people are buying them and [flipping them for a profit](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ev-demand-hot-tesla-owners-130053046.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANHvSbPBAE8x2cRMY7zQW8Bh2BJ71ASrYJKMvonSDHx8fOciXg3Lg5N7KceVzJqbNRZn78K_kHmMUvdtPthj-oRWLxICbF2NRzw2rsBdAn0P5p6Z327NDxWSmavxLerwWQKQ668JzQnEkEopIF6-OSL4YY29IYA8yWXqSrC5g2dr). And global demand for EVs is forecast to continue exploding.

There are other reasons why Tesla demand will remain high, and likely higher than other brands, that including the Super charger network of course, and Tesla insurance could become a big factor.

&gt;But how long can that brand sustain given Tesla’s shoddy build quality and poor engineering?

There are of course areas where Tesla can improve. And they do [keep improving](https://www.teslarati.com/teslas-build-quality-sees-slight-improvement-in-j-d-powers-2022-initial-quality-study/). But I think the most important area to improve is service, Tesla [seems to agree](https://electrek.co/2022/06/06/tesla-service-majority-appointments-same-day-repairs/) looking to make that a priority.

So in answer your main question, ""is Tesla actually ahead of the competition?"", it has to be said they probably are in at least the areas of R&amp;D, manufacturing, software, hardware, demand, and profit margins.",positive

Citadel is hedging... so when gme went up nearly 100% last month (flipped $1k to $20k hehe) you can bet they recouped a chunk of their loss. The trades are public, you don’t have to just take my word for it.

[I don't know the software part but I heard it's basically capable software.   However a number of years ago the CEO (founder?) convinced his board that instead of holding cash they should put their cash into virtual currency.  Since then they keep buying up those same currencies, and instead of their cash account being stable, it's been explosive and now the company is basically valued on how much currency it holds and buys.    At first blush I'd thought the software business was a front for the other, but to hear him speak apparently the software was first and they still take running the software part seriously.](/r/stocks/comments/q8bcnc/prepare_your_portfolio_for_extended_inflation/hgsf80t/)

[**TSLA clown circus is painful to watch, along with CEO Clown Musk, sure I get you want to pitch whatever your selling but 24/7 hype driven stock price run up's ? Take the recent $780 to $835 move if you bought options most of the profit is priced in and THETA would make it like your betting on Coca Cola or Caterpillar making a move. Yeah if you had 1000 shares you made $55,000 in 7 days but you need $780,000 to begin with. I think this whole boom and bust is a money laundering, very sophisticated Ponzi scheme, kinda like a picture of some royal cockroach 'Duke of Waterloo' selling for $500 million. EV car makers dime a dozen, space travel it's already over saturated, satellite internet, no barrier to entry. If I had Burry's bank balance I too would say 'Fuck Musk' and his fairy tales.

[Are you vlad? It's money, I'd rather have my broker be legit than have a ""cool UI"". I've never used RH, but did have a webull account for my active account, which I am slowly transitioning out of. If you know the market, and know the way things work, why would you want anything to do with a broker who doesn't do things the ""right way""? Genuine question as you are going out of your way to defend RH endlessly, you can also get reduced options fees from the big brokers by request. Also I believe IBKR and Tastyworks but have a smaller fee structure than the big brokers if that .65 really bothers you. I also constantly read things about bad fills on RH and webull, though I don't 100% believe them, as there's no real way to confirm that as bid/ask is always changing. The way I see it though is why take a chance with my money, whether any of the rumors are true or not it doesn't change the fact that they do things that are not standard. That is enough of an uncertainty to me, while it took a bit to get used to ToS/TD it is a reputable broker without countless class action lawsuits, constant bad publicity, and I haven't heard of their CEO having his cell snatched by the FBI. Totally worth 1.30(tops) per options round trip, which if you know what you are doing is miniscule in the grand scheme of things.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q8wbyp/lost_100k_cuz_robinhood/hgt1nyi/)

Also the buyback was been underutilized because they don't want to lose the Russell index inclusion but the CEO could just as easily reduce his ownership stake by 5% to protect the float and utilize the buyback to its full potential.

"It may be difficult to predict what the commercial revenue growth will look like through 2024.  

We do know from the Q4 ‘21 slides that Foundry commercial customers who bought into the software platform during 2019 tended to spend more in each successive year.  More customers purchasing more use should over time should result in the revenue curve soaring upwards at some point and creating profitability.  However, we don’t know if and when that tipping point might occur.  

I remember with Tesla that the tipping point became apparent in 2020, after the Shanghai factory opened, production skyrocketed, and consistent profitability became undeniable.  

My strategy is to keep accumulating PLTR shares and wait, like I did with TSLA for over 9 years.  I didn’t know when Tesla would reach takeoff when I bought shares in 2011-2012.  I took the calculated risk that they would possibly take off at some indeterminate future date.

"I’ll give My opinion from the day I test drove a Y back to back with a Mach E. (I had never driven either one and I don’t yet own an EV)

The mustang was boring. While it had a nice enough interior, it didn’t stand out from the dozens of cars I’ve sat inside in the last few years. Same with the way it drove- it didn’t feel special. It felt like any modern gas powered SUV.  Then I drove the Y. Even before the car moved, it felt special. Next level. This was not my father’s Oldsmobile. Then I started driving and everything changed. Precise, tight steering with a quick ratio. Instant throttle response and massive torque. It felt a decade ahead of any car I’ve ever driven, and it made my bmw M3 sports coupe feel like a loose bucket of bolts. There was no comparison. If a person is a driving enthusiast, and they compare the Mach E to the Model Y, it is impossible to prefer the Ford. It’s not even close. I still don’t have an EV, but the next day I took my entire life’s savings in my retirement fund and put it all in TSLA. That comparison test drive is why I’m a TSLA investor.",positive

"It's very likely that Musk hasn't borrowed anything yet. There's a chance he's been selling, but even that seems a little pre-mature.

The twitter deal is expected to close this year, if they haven't gotten at least regulatory approval within 6 months than either side can back out, and there's an overall time limit of 1 year to get it done. And either side can pay $1billion to back out before then.

Musk probably won't finalize the loans until the deal is almost ready to close, or at least they'll wait to determine the final number of shares, value, etc. until that point. There's also going to be a lot of other people investing with him, so it'll take time to get all that squared away.

I'd say there's basically zero chance that Musk gets margin called before the deal closes, and hopefully wouldn't go through with the deal if Tesla stock drops a ton and he'd be on the brink of insolvency to make it happen. If it comes down to risking over a hundred billion in Tesla stock, or paying a billion to get out of it, it would make sense to just pay the penalty.

There's a lot of fear and uncertainty in the market right now, just from general economic and global fears. And adding this Twitter deal on top of it might be freaking some people out in regards to Tesla stock as well. But I'd guess there's also a lot of short term options plays happening that are moving the stock price a lot. And then there's the chance that there are people trying to push TSLA down to put selling pressure on Musk or maybe make it harder for him to do the Twitter deal?

Before the deal Tesla's market cap was about 1 trillion, Musk is borrowing about 12.5 billion against some of his shares, that's about 1% of the value of the Tesla's market cap. Tesla trades around 25 billion in shares on average, every day. A deal that involves 1/2 of 1 day's volume of shares shouldn't (and might not) have this kind of effect on the share price. Musk could sell around 100k shares every day, for 6 months, which would be like a 0.5% increase in daily volume and just raise the cash directly instead of borrowing.

I think it's a combination of people being irrationally afraid of a deal they don't really understand, and other people taking advantage of that fear to manipulate the price in the short term.",positive
"My theory is that some of these people have a lot of TSLA stock and want the company to earn all it possibly can. Tesla doesn’t make money when you make repairs and do maintenance yourself.

The few questions I asked before eventually buying one got me nothing but downvotes and people questioning my motives (most specifically, when asking if an air-gapped Model S with Free charging will retain Supercharging functionality, everyone asked why I would buy a Tesla if I wanted an offline car despite my qualifying it beforehand) instead of offering anything constructive.

"I used to think investing in a company helps it directly, but sadly while it can help usually it's indirect. When you buy shares its always from another shareholder so tsla doesn't see any money from that.

Here's how it helps indirectly)

1. Higher Valuation allows Tesla to capital raise if necessary at better terms, and diluting equity instead of taking on debt is a nice option to have.

2. Hopefully incentivize employees as they get stock options, although too much growth can actually disincentivize, so this one is tricky.

3. Keeps Elon happy and motivated, not that he's not motivated, but when the stock is really low it seemed to stress him out a ton, probably from worries about company bankruptcy, but that is not a major concern now.",positive

EVs. And the one I'm evaluating the most for trading is LCID but I'm not sold on it long term. TSLA has transformed that industry and I might just sell options on it instead.

I'm waiting for deep sea mining plays. None are coming up on the horizon though. It's almost more difficult to do than space.

Those areas are the biggest growth of the future...Space the biggest most likely and it really only has one investment grade public company. And their management has one of the best strategy teams I've ever seen.

There was one time Tsla went down a lot during his short, yet he went on TV saying he's still shorting but not before long Tsla shot straight up. So I really didn't know his timing. It's either huge gain or huge loss (if he didn't close his short in time). That said, it seems to me that his shorting position is often exaggerated by media, like he had bet his whole life in those shorts while in reality it's only a small part of his portfolio.",positive

"TSLA &amp; index combo (VT, VTI, VEA, VWO, ZCN). Also simulate a clean tech index with broad holdings (+2 dozen), but Telsa is my single biggest, and all of these are held with a multi-decade time horizon.

Tesla has 'crossed the chasm' in developing a product so has been significantly de-risked compared to competitors - none of which yet are able to generate positive cash flows on their EV business, for which it took Tesla over a decade to accomplish (it was Jan 2020 that this functionally happened). Their profit margin profile looking forward is likely to be in the magnitiude of Apple's depending on the segment, and my price scenarios in a 10 year time horizon span between $4T ultra bear case, to probable $10-$15T, and ultra bull case closer to $50T. It might be more accurate to say the have a solid path to get to $100T in 2-3 decades, but timing on that is dependent on many factors and it is so far out. Was the first stock I've bought (years before the 2020 bull run), have dollar cost averaged in, continue to buy - but spread my investments wider for diversification because I am already overly concentrated. And I'm not selling.",positive

"[Edit: TLDR: what u/ev01ution said, there’s never enough money.  ————————————————————————  I think they just want to cash out while they can still guarantee a relatively high IPO.   This is just my opinion, but the IPO market has been insane the past 2 years. Countless companies raising record capital and some being overvalued. I believe the cycle is winding down, and that this is their last chance to get a higher than normal IPO and cash out (at least for the short term).   Not all of the data below directly relates to Reddit IPO, but they are all intertwined. When the equity market is frothy, SPACS popping off, crypto going bananas, etc, this allows companies to IPO higher. Markets dont like uncertainty. If Russia attacks Ukraine, and lets say threatens European countries to not intervine or they cut their oil/gas (this is all extremely speculative, just trying to create an example) this will have an impact on markets. Could amplify other macro events and markets go lower, then Reddit cannot raise as much at IPO.   My reasoning:  -	S&amp;P 500 is set to end higher this year for the third year in a row. Analysts predict a rally in 2022, but a four year streak has only happened 5 times in the past century -	Fed announcing 3 rate hikes for 2022 -	Crypto/NFT mania seems to be cooling off -	Winter season with Omnicron variant/covid/flu -	S&amp;P and Nasdaq are heavily weighted and being held up by a few tech giants. Look under the hood at all the other companies and their returns -	2021 record year for IPOs and SPACs; see below -	SPAC boom/bust: most SPACs are down since the boom in February. CLOV down 73% YTD, SPCE down 37.7% YTD, OPEN down 40% YTD, SOFI up 20%. ($2.45) YTD -	Recent IPOs: Coinbase down 29% since IPO, Rivian down 25% since IPO, Bumble down 56% since IPO, Robinhood’s ath after their IPO was $85, is now trading $19.10, Oatly down 64% since IPO, Coursera down 47% since IPO, Lemonade (2020 IPO) down 59% YTD, Beyond (2019 IPO) down 52% YTD, Peloton (2019 IPO) down 71% YTD -	2020 IPO Upstart Holdings up 216% YTD, but has been on a downtrend since hitting all time high in October. Past 3 months is down 54%. I call this out as an example of frothy, since the clip of someone pumping this on CNBC and couldn’t answer when asked what the company does -	Oil/Gas issues. When oil went negative in 2020, some refineries and pumps were permanetly closed. CNBC and Bloomberg had oil people on who explained this. You cant just quickly reopen/restart them. US crude oil production is projected to return to 2019 levels in 2023. The amount of crude oil processed at US refineries is projected to return to 2019 levels by 2025.   As I previously stated, this is all my opinion. I’m a complete amateur. I love this stuff and am trying to become a trader at a firm, but realistically I dont know anything and am probably wrong about a lot. I’ve been wrong countless times in 2020/21.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rj5cgx/short_reddit_after_they_ipo/hp38ux8/)

"I think it’s admirable that you have formed your opinion, but I think you should understand that selling BEVs is only part of the answer. Servicing is the main revenue source for traditional automakers, a service that is largely absent for EVs. Cars are distributed via dealers, who make very little from car sales and the majority of their revenue from servicing. As the transition to EVs accelerates this is a business model that requires distribution centres rather than dealerships which is why I think new automakers have a better shot than existing ones that need to transform their entire business model. Having said all this I think VW is the leader of the legacy automakers pack so they are a good bet. I think there is definitely a lot of growth already priced into Tesla at the moment but still a lot of opportunity as well. FSD if they can actually pull it off could easily become a 1-2tn dollar market cap for TSLA, grid storage as well, and then in ten years time, Generalised robotics, so definitely there’s room to grow over the next 10 years.

"A few where I sold some stocks WAY too soon...

- I once owned 30 shares of AMZN bought at $33 in 1999. Sold at like $110 a few years later. Would be worth about $100k now.

- I sold all my AAPL in 2014 ahead of buying a house, not knowing my parents were going to gift wife and me a significant portion of down payment. Had I known they were going to do that, I would have sold 100 shares and kept 35. Those 35, split adjusted would now be almost 1000 shares worth $170k. (As an aside, if I still owned all those shares, I'd be able to buy my house outright -- even with the currently inflated housing prices!)

- Bought 40 shares of TSLA within the first 2 weeks after their IPO, for something like $18 and again sold when I doubled my money... that would now be 200 shares worth over $200k.

- I eventually bought back into TSLA, but TSLA stock was very volatile in Feb/Mar 2020... I was having surgery &amp; not sure how well I'd be able to follow it, so I set a sell order at a price like 20% below where it was trading. Intraday on 3/16/20, day before my surgery, it had a crash where it dropped enough to trigger that sale price, yet closed down only a little. Would now be over $75k.

DM had already hit $30 million for revenue for the year in Q2, one would think the stock should have at least been priced at half that number which would be a quarter of the $60 million run rate for the year.  ($15 million x 10 = $0.42).   $15 million would currently be the money the company has in bank when last we heard.  The company is proving out the revenue for the year with clean books, money in the bank, MediCall and an expanding AI sector into various verticals.  I think it's fair to look at DM based on a minimum $60 million run rate for the year.  1x valuation = $0.17 (fully diluted = $0.14) 2x valuation = $0.34 (fully diluted = $0.28) 3x valuation = $0.51 (fully diluted = $0.42) 4x valuation = $0.68 (fully diluted = $0.56) 5x valuation = $0.85 (fully diluted = $0.71) 6x valuation = $1.11 (fully diluted = $0.85) 7x valuation = $1.29 (fully diluted = $0.99) 8x valuation = $1.48 (fully diluted = $1.13) 9x valuation = $1.66 (fully diluted = $1.27) 10x valuation = $1.69 (fully diluted = $1.41)  Other companies from health and AI sectors   Empower Clinics - CBDT (Healthcare) Current share price: $0.335 Market Cap: $112 milion Q2 revenue: $2.8 million Currently trading at 3.98x revenue EPS (-0.24)  However, this is due to warrants being exercised - mostly a paper loss, not real cash loss.  Therma Bright - THRM (Healthcare) Current share price: $0.385  Market Cap: $84 million Revenue: $3 521 (9 months ended April, 2021)  Currently trading at 24055x revenue (Yes, that is correct, 24 thousand fifty-five times!) EPS (-0.05)  CoudMD - DOC (Healthcare) Current share price: $1.36  Market Cap: $316 million Q2 revenue: $2.8 million Currently trading at 113x revenue  EPS (-0.12)  Fobi AI - FOBI (AI) Current share price: $1.53  Market Cap: $220 million Revenue: $10 016 (9 months ended April, 2021) Currently trading at 22149x revenue (Yes, this is also correct based on the most updated infomation I could find on their revenue.  I'm sure their revenue is higher now, but there was no information for Q2 on Sedar) EPS (-0.09)  The next 5 are condsidered the top junior AI companies in an article I found Nov. 4th, 2021  DeepSpatial - DSAI (AI) Current share price: $0.16  Market Cap: $15 million Q2 revenue: no revenue, operating at a loss ($1.2 million cash on hand - I used this) Currently trading at 12.5x cash on hand  (i.e. this number should be higher, with no revenue) EPS (-0.03)  Zoomd Tech - ZOMD (AI) Current share price: $0.59  Market Cap: $56 million Q2 revenue: 18 million Currently trading at 3.1x revenue EPS (-0.04)  Certive Solutions - CBP (AI) Current share price: $0.055  Market Cap: $7.89 million Q2 revenue: $263 836 Currently trading at 30x revenue EPS (-0.01)  Mobilum Technologies - MBLM (AI) Current share price: $0.24  Market Cap: $37.53 million Q2 revenue: Operating at a loss ($6.9 million cash on hand - I'll use the cash on hand) Currently trading at 5.4x cash on hand (i.e. this number should be far higher, with no revenue) EPS (-0.12)  Plurilock Security - PLUR (AI) Current share price: $0.50  Market Cap: $35 million Q2 revenue: $8.6 million Currently trading at 4x revenue EPS (-0.15)  I don't know what else to say.  Comparing DM to other AI or healthcare stocks shows that DM is so far undervalued that the stock price has no other direction, but to go up.  DM is the only one with a positive EPS and yet based on the revenue alone trades far below the other stocks in valuation.  DM also has a clean balance sheet and money in the bank.  A number of those stocks are trading far beyond their current revenue stream or at least the most up-to-date revenue I could find on sedar (i.e. THRM and FOBI).  And for others where I could not find a revenue number I was generous to use their cash on hand instead.  **********Citation End*********](/r/pennystocks/comments/r13u5b/rounding_bottom_golden_cross_extremely_bullish_dm/hlw76xd/)

NYSE:ETH / 6

[Well I'm doing it for around six months with an account around 1.7k (with using daily around 100$) and I've only had 4 losing days in the beginning until I figured it our. Personally I do it in crypto, but all trades are executed within one minute. The trick is that I use spot trading and when transfering money between exchanges, I use fast and cheap blockchain to minimize time and money needed to do it. Second trick is to find assets that are likely to appreciate against USD/EUR/GBP etc...  For example, I have 0.1BTC and 1 ETH. I'll deposit 0.05BTC and 0.5 ETH to exchange A and the other half on exchange B. I keep both orderbooks open and watch for overlapping. Once I spot the opportunity, I execute it. sometimes opportunities are large enough so you can't be overrun by the steamroller. And I do it over and over without transfering money between exchanges. But sometimes I end up with mostly BTC on one exchange and ETH on another. That's when you have to carefully transfer money between using XLM or TRON to minimize network fees.  I guess that you'd have to withdraw cash Nd deposit agaib if you dealt with stocks, but I'm not sure as I've never traded thsoe this way...](/r/Daytrading/comments/qbrbch/advice_on_growing_a_small_account_1000_to_25k_to/hhgndxq/)

TSLA is cheaper, less rigid, don't come with insole, and is probably more roomy than primus lite. Though when I mean cheap, I mean in price and quality of gluing, but work well even with some parts peeling off. Grip of both shoes are great flat surfaces like padded floors in gyms and both are adequete for lifting.

"Goog, meta, and Amzn are on my short list.

Nflx is out because growth is stalled, bad moat and lackluster financials 

Intc out because competition is just way ahead and it’ll be forever until their manufacturing catches up to what everyone else is simply outsourcing to Taiwan semiconductors

Adbe is super interesting actually but I haven’t done enough research to make an informed decision. Kickass business model and makes a ton of money. Will be looking into this one heavily over the next few weeks

V - rock solid no brainer stock but valuation isn’t attractive enough yet, not with Meta, AMZN, and SHOP trading where they’re at. 

MU - Another valuation hesitation, willing to wait and see if it really takes a dump before I get in. Same sentiment with amd and nvda. Not quite the bargain they need to be to get my investing dollars yet

Bkng- Lackluster growth compared to other companies in the travel sector. really favor ABNB in this sector

None of the others on your list are even on my radar aside from Amat but I don’t have a strong opinion about Amat.

Things you should check out

ABNB - do a deep dive and check out their growth prospects, phenomenal technology based business model where the bare costs are low and they’re just making commission on booking transactions, same as BKNG but they’re primed to disrupt the hotel industry and what’s even better they’re CREATING AN INDUSTRY OF THEIR OWN. It’s like Apple inventing a product no one knew they needed and within a decade everyone has one. It’s even changed the house buying industry and real estate investment industry, it’s really crazy to think of the kind of money they will make 10 years from now. The bad news is they have a shit moat with a pretty low barrier to entry. Just like Uber eats, it’s not hard for a Postmates, door dash etc.. to pop up and compete, and a couple already have. The good news is they are so dominant in the space it and their brand is so strong I could see them easily becoming the winner of the race. 

If you’re bullish on crypto take a serious look at grayscale bitcoin trust, it’s one of the few places hedge funds can place capital in the crypto space, and for some reason is now trading below the value of bitcoin it holds. Usually it trades at a 15-30% premium over the price of bitcoin and it’s only a matter of time before that corrects regardless of the direction of bitcoin. Basically unless crypto tanks much farther from here and never recovers, this is the best bang for your buck exposure to bitcoin you can get, even better than buying bitcoin directly.

I really really really like Tesla, strong balance sheet, good cash flow, kcikass growth, and the little something that you can’t put your finger on that makes them always a step ahead of the competition and working on futuristic life changing things that no one else is even dreaming of.  Aside from Apple, if anyone has a shot at catching lightning in a bottle (inventing something g people don’t know they need yet but everyone will want) it’s TSLA.  The stupid robot alone could dwarf their car business 10 years from now let alone robotaxi technology and all the other wacky crap they somehow manage to pull out of their ass. If TSLA starts going below $500 I’m going to be adding aggressively and not selling for 20 years even if it goes to $10 trillion I. Market cap the day after

"Complete moron here. three years ago I got robin hood, transferred in $300 and just started buying and selling stocks with zero concern for taxes, quarterly reports, dividends, PE, anything. I still basically do that, except I transferred in a bunch of money. I got lucky listening to WSB and eventually turned 30k into 50k, thats right I made money.

Also, they're claiming to have HFC technology as well. So there are definitely positives.

"I remember seeing a Model S for the first time in a mall in Newport Beach in 2012 and it instantly clicked in my head that this is exactly how cars should be (low center of gravity, fully electric, instant torque, few moving parts, sexy). 

I am not a car guy but I was so excited I took home a brochure so I could remember to research the company more. 

I told my wife I was going to buy at $25 (pre-split, $5 today), but saw it move to $30 and decided to wait. 

Then life happened and I forgot about it for a while and when I remembered to check again it was at $130 (still pre-split, so $26 today). 

Again I held off buying because of valuation concerns… until I saw their announcement with the Model 3. Then I decided to accumulate as much as possible. 

So I bought most of the shares between $130 and $285 pre-split, paying prices that were far higher than when I first started thinking about the company. 

Also at the time the company was unprofitable so it was hard to value future Model 3 sales and profit margins. 

They also were only making the S at the time and had yet to run into near-death experience while trying to ramp Model 3. 

But I thought that TSLA had a bright future and with economies of scale would be able to grow way past their lofty valuation once they got to mass manufacturing stage. 

So it’s easy to think you’re late when you’re showing up at $130 and you’re mentally anchored to a $25 price. But actually $130 was very very early given that we are at $3875 today. However to get to the promised land you just need to be willing to take multiple 50% dips along the way (so much pain) and hold. 

Today, FSD is many times the opportunity that Model 3 represented to the company when it was first announced. And there are other irons in the fire (energy, 4680, robotaxi, dojo, AI bots…)

Even at these “lofty” valuation levels I’m more excited about Tesla than ever before. With 9B cash on the balance sheet and with free cash flow growing quarter over quarter Tesla has much less existential risk than ever in its history while simultaneously having many more massive opportunities to invest their resources into—like they’re going to be taking on literally multiple trillion dollar markets in energy, autonomy, artificial intelligence. 

We are so very early today.",positive
"Agreed. But I think first the car will have to be taught to obey the cop over existing traffic laws. Then, after that era, the car will have to be able to be culturally aware of what a real cop looks like compared to a fake one. Then add in how cops look different in every region of the planet.... As I keep saying, FSD will have to be culturally and socially aware at levels above your average teenage human. If a robot car can know all these details about society then we will also have robots all around us like ""The Jetsons""... I love that Tesla is working on this future but I really don't get why so many TSLA investors think we will be living in the world of ""The Jetsons"" in 5 years... Like the Flying Car, this world is always 100 years away...",positive
"I thought Tesla's valuation was more about it getting autonomous 5 first and becoming like 90% of cars on the road in 50 years. Which would make it undervalued currently. If it gets that early enough before others it could monopolize automobiles.

Lucid is my biggest holding and I own no tsla. But lucid need to first deliver the cars it has reserved and keep growing at a good pace.

But, doesn’t it seem odd to you that BlockBuster video spiked around 700% along with Sears and other bankrupt companies on the same day GME and the other meme stocks did? I believe it’s because they never close the short positions. If they did, a few things would likely happen, 1. The buy pressure in closing said positions would cause the price to rise. 2. They would realize the gains and have to pay taxes on those profits.

[I'm with you, IGNORE all the reasonable advice about research and DD. I DON'T trade stocks I trade emotion. Early in my trading career (yep been doing it for MANY years... successfully) I realized that there are way smarter people, analyzing, doing DD than me. And many of them still lose money. Most hedge funds can't even beat the indices, and they have a lot of people doing their research. If its truly about fundamentals why is TSLA worth more than F (in  all metrics), how did GME get over $300 a share, who was buying VIAC at $100 (and it's not just Bill buying)....Its EMOTION   - fear /greed... YOLO/FOMO.   IS a fair price for AMC $20 or $15 .... YES if someone is willing to sell or buy it. Good luck with all your DD research, because you won't find the answer.   Remember you are in a mental WAR with every other trader, hedge fund, stock holder. You are trying to take their money and they are trying to take yours. On every trade the buyer and the seller, both think they are doing the right trade, yet both have their reasons to buy or sell.   I watch market sentiment and charts, that my analysis. I usually have both longs and shorts at the same time (so market sentiment only plays a small part of my decision). Cut your losses, NEVER let a stock go 20% against you. If after I enter a position and its working against me, when I start looking at P/E or value.....I'm already F\*CKed.  I have to remind myself I don't trade fundamentals; I trade emotion.   This works for me. It took a long time to find ""my"" system... and admittedly there are other one that work for others. Clearly your's isn't working for you.

[Ok, this is the info I needed to respond. Sorry if this sounds harsh, but direct is all I know. You are not ready to be full-time. You need capital. Capital for expenses, at least 12-18 months worth, and capital to trade with. You can justify taking out loans for your wife’s school but it’s all the same ledger, so in essence you are going into debt further to chase a career, quite frankly, you’re still a bit delusional (rose colored glasses style) about. You have 10k, are not free from PDT, and want to draw down $4k of that each month. Even if you make $25k by June, and let’s give you the crazy benefit that you could triple that in the next year, that’s only $50k more and you’re drawing down $48k in 12 months? What if down month, what if emergency, what if unexpected expense? The first time you don’t make $4k in a month, you screw your account. You cannot understand the pressure of NEEDing $4k profits every month to survive. That alone will screw your trading.  You say you are a planner, but most of what you laid out sounds more like longer term dreams vs actionable steps/goals. Gonna 150% your account in 8 months to get to $25k? How? If you’re insisting that to make 150% you’ll need to close the door on med school, but you’ll be able to take full loads of accounting and finance classes, that’s just absurd. FOR SURE, don’t close the med school door on a hope and a dream of making it as a trader. You say you are willing to grind. Prove it to yourself. EARN being a full-time trader. Work your ass off at a job that will allow you to trade at least the first half of the day. Budget and live like homeless people to save up enough capital cushion to avoid any need to draw down your account for the first full-time trading year. Spend like you’re broke the first year of trading. Hopefully at this point you have enough capital in the account to help you weather a size-able drawdown. If med school would be free you should also just run a quick breakeven analysis as if you were refinancing a home. By that I mean, how long from right now on the shrink path until you have made as much as the trading path. Let’s say you make $70-100k/ yr avg being generous, 4 years into shrink work (12 years total) would be about 1.2m in earnings either way. 20 years in you’re at ~2m trading vs 3.6m shrink.  So, TLDR; finish pre-med, get a job that allows you to trade first half of day, live like peasants, save 12-18months expenses, then step into full-time and keep living like a peasant until capital improves. If it works great. If not study for the MCAT go to med school. Better to take the jump from the plane if you have the itch to experience skydiving, just don’t jump out without a parachute, that’s just suicide.](/r/Daytrading/comments/qogeav/need_serious_advice/hjpwf44/)

I think the economy has changed and you should also consider buying the future, like robotics, space, biotechnology and bio pharmaceutical and green.

[Not an expert either but what I look for is consensus. Googling (setting time filter 1 month max) and looking for stocks that come up again and again. If not wanting to jump into something that appears to be on the rise up up and up thinking you missed the boat look/learn about support and resistance and moving averages and can set a limit order to buy. Or, as you have minimal funds and sound like you don't want to wait, set an alert on several like FB or MSFT.   And I also got murdered this earnings season on similar stocks... and got lucky enough to buy into Chinese stocks right before the series of negative news came out about restrictions (insert eye roll)](/r/StockMarket/comments/pht5kk/i_got_some_buying_power_any_recommendations/hbkv390/)

[It affects them because the majority of their profits are well into the future, due to the majority of their  growth being ahead of them. SQ's P/E ratio is 127 and their price-to-free cash flow is 111. Those numbers have to come down, and they will need time to get them to a more reasonable level. All highly valued companies need that time.  That time puts their future cash flows more into the future, even if by only a few years, compared to say a GOOG who is hitting on all cylinders at present with a P/E and P/FCF of 28. This is comparing growth company to growth company. It will take time for SQ to get their valuation down, and in a high rate environment, that time becomes more costly that it has in the past.  Lyn Alden wrote a very good article illustrating the difference. Her rate examples are too high, but she notes that the effect is similar with lower but rising rates.  (https://www.lynalden.com/interest-rate-effects/)  I agree pricing power is key, and if they have a wide moat, will be in better shape than many companies. Brainpower is only as good as its ability to affect future earnings or cash flows.  Edit: IF you do a DCF analysis on a new growth company vs. an established, the effect of even short rate hikes get magnified over a 10-20 year period. To the degree to which this affects any given stock like SQ is unknown, but it does present a headwind for growth stocks (which we are seeing in the market presently)](/r/stocks/comments/s3z5fg/a_warning_if_your_companies_are_not_selffunding/hsosmne/)

All those boomer houses are going to hit the market, and who is going to buy them? Many zoomers and millennials are burdened by student loan debt and are having trouble saving the down payment, even if they could  make the mortgage payments. Increased supply of boomer houses with decreased demand because of inability to afford the down payment plus rising interest rates spells collapse of the housing bubble.

[The simple answer is maybe. It really comes down to each company and how the company is operating as a business. At the end of the day, you are buy business when you invest. It's not as simple as if you believe in a company, it's more about does the company have underlying fundamentals.   On top of that, no one can predict macro-economic events after years.   I've learned that it's a better bet to invest in good performing companies that have proof of performance rather than relying on hype or belief.   Something like NFLX, it wasn't until like 2012 to 2016, did their revenue really start to explode as a company.  I'd rather pick up shares when the company is primed for growth and really showing.   Even solid companies like MSFT, it hit a high in 2000's and took 15 years to get back to those same ATH's of the 2000's.   If you are really looking at a long time investment, it's hard to make any predictions on companies that have like 1 to 2 years of yearnings, especially during a pandemic. The safer bet for money and growth over a long time is going with passive index/etf's.](/r/stocks/comments/s3p9kn/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_jan/hsnx4jv/)

Elon is only doing that because the politicians he attacks created a system that rewarded him doing it.

[Hmm.. I am in the stock market for only 4 months and I never talked about a market crash..  There won't be a crash, I think people are missing the fact that while the stock market has been going up a lot, it is mostly the big companies that have been pulling the weight upwards.   Think how much MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, TSLA and NVDA have gained YTD while the VTI hasn't done even close to most.  YTD:     VTI is up 22%.     AAPL is up 28%.     GOOGL is up 66% (GOOG about the same).     TSLA is up 38%.   MSFT is up 50%.   NVDA is up 129%.  These are only part of the companies that pulled the stock market up this year and they are massive companies, look at how the rest of the stock market is doing in order to lower the percentage gains of those companies.  VB (small cap) is up 15.5% YTD.     VO (mid cap) is up 21% YTD.  The Russell 2000 index is up ""merely"" 13% YTD (down about 10% since the beginning of November).  The entire market looks as if it is in a bubble or at least doing extremely well, but it only looks that way.  That is also without mentioning (https://www.ft.com/content/dd9a7b72-1f9b-4b66-ac75-200d1653ce6f), making it go up even higher than it would naturally.

"I fully understood the point you are making since I have been arguing with your kinds for years now but  I don't think you understood the idiosyncrasy with what you are saying.

You will need to find someone who is willing to buy your ""growth"" shares for the price you set, there's nothing backing that price behind hopeium. Hence in a crash, normally those fictitious ""growth"" get wiped first.

The ""growth"" companies you are talking about like TSLA, etc... all have crazy PE Ratio and they do not have the revenue nor the short term path to profitability, the price is all based on hopiums and mental masturbation of clueless investors.

Dividend-paying companies are all paying investors from the real cash-flow real revenues of the companies. Sure stock price will drop when the dividends are paid but it will be replenished by the next month/quarter as new revenues come in. What you are saying is like comparing empty the coin drawer of a washing machine at a laundromat to selling the portions of the washing machines to generate your ""cash flow"".

[INTC is a value trap. ARM is taking over in a big way, as seen by apple M1 chips. The market for x86 and use case is diminishing as electronics are getting either smaller, or require more energy efficiency, which ARM beats x86 on. On a logic chip basis too, they are a generation behind or more compared to companies like TSMC, whose CAPEX dwarfs that of INTC, and this is an industry where it is exponentially more difficult to get to those smaller nm chips. INTC does not have an edge here. So we've discussed their logic chip issues, but haven't really addressed why it moves differently to NVDA. Well NVDA specializes in GPU, and a lot of the processing that you are seeing at data centres etc, are using GPUs, to which NVDA and AMD are in competition in that market, with NVDA quite a dominant player. INTC doesn't really hold a candle to them. So, wrapping all this together, NVDA has quite a moat in their technology, with a future runway of use cases that is only growing whereas INTC is losing on all their core businesses, as well as businesses they are trying to get into.

[Good, well managed growth tech that has been caught in the indiscriminate selling:  Profitable: FB, AMZN, PYPL, AMD, NVDA, PANW, CRM, QCOM  No earnings: SNOW, CRWD, NET, XM, ASAN, TWTR, ABNB, U, RBLX  These are some of my favorites. Incredibly well run companies that will still be here in the next 10 years. Probably some of the no earnings ones need to come back down more, I’d like to see NET at $60 for example before nibbling back, which is about 25% below its current price, some, I think are at an attractive price, eg. XM, TWTR.  Profitable tech generates so much cash it’s ridiculous, buy and hold forever.  Cybersecurity is going to be a huge sector moving forward, and I don’t want to see earnings, I want to see solid gross margins but reinvesting every penny they make for growth.  Also, if economic growth is slowing down, the stocks that end up going up will always be the companies that can keep growing, not cyclicals, not value, not economically sensitive: growth.

Check Macrotrends for ""Shares Outstanding"" and you will see why. What i am curious is whether Alphabet will deploy their growing cash pile in the same fashion in the upcoming future, in which case i would argue they too should be valued as such. NVDA got alittle ahead of itself and badly needed the ongoing correction which ideally should continue alittle further while AMD seems far more reasonably priced. Amazon looks pricy on a P/E basis, but they reinvest their cashflow far more aggresively than the other companies listed, therefore their P/E always seemed ridiculous - P/S relative to their ROE, revenue growth and ROI give a better picture of their historical valuation.](/r/stocks/comments/set0lg/is_big_tech_really_overvalued/hulj0gu/)

Just imagine this Tesla sells 30M vehicles (\~40% of global vehicle sales) and 20% of to total rev is the net income. At a average selling price of 75k (future pricing because of inflation and FSD which adds better margin revenue to the cost) that is a total of 450B on the bottom line.

[BABA is just pricing in the fact that the CCP doesn’t give a fuck about foreign investors and could easily force the companies to pull their stocks from foreign markets. When you buy BABA, you’re not actually buying a part of the company, you are buying a derivative which you can’t know will honored. Therefore, you have to assign a much higher risk premium, making BABA’s earnings unattractive.   Not saying TSLA is properly priced, but you’ve got to realize that an American company with the growth rate and dominance of BABA would have like a 30-50x PE (see Amazon).](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pfbqjy/teslas_market_cap_is_73033_billion_with_a/hb5irip/)

Lyft was also in that business. 2021 should be their best year to prove it can be profitable.  It blew it blaming the driver wage was the cause.  Now we got gas at $5.69 in CA why would drivers want that gig?   Why is DoorDash not making a profit?

[  My 2 Cents:   They seem like a solid investment in the longterm, and could experience a short spike if it turns out that people actually do have enough money to travel.   **For Long Term** I'd look into larger brand names, and stay away from Air Rentals.  **For short term** I would eye up cheaper hotels, or an air-rental and things with strong brand names.  *Ye be warned longer post ahead with no precise answer*  **Thoughts**  From a macro trend it seems like there is a slight shift away from large hotels, and luxury travel real estate. The shift is more towards ABNB and personal residential rentals...  However from gauging the current climate of housing, abnb/other residential rental facilitstors are likely going to be wading into choppy waters as housing shortages will likey cause legal and zoning reform/pushback against this type of investment practice in the coming times.  In the long run this would suggest that it becomes less profitibale than previously anticipated, or potentially that the practice is outlawed altogether.  **My Conclusion:**  Thus coupling proven history, prestige, and reputation, I suspect more efficient destiation oriented type hotel companies will continue to stand the test of time and be worth more than they currently are being valued at.  **Less likely but possible**  Though if there is no regulation or huge push back against abnb/other vacation rentals it will not be as drastic and large vacation rentals/hotels market share control could shrink.  **Final words**  Its a good idea to track legislation and bills to see how this will shake out, as well as see what congress people are investing in.](/r/stocks/comments/umkacr/thoughts_on_hotel_stocks/i8255lq/)

&gt;Could TSLA do another stock offering soon? Or do they already have enough cash? I just get a sense that they'd want to capitalize on the run up this time and secure more liquidity. They know tapering is done and QT will be a liquidity drain.

[Also let’s not forget about technology bc these are basically RC cars come to life.  Rivian boasts upwards to about a 500 mile range on one of their packages while Ford, still being one of the better traditional auto manufacturers in this area, only advertises about 300 mile ranges for their higher end.  I’m still bullish on Ford bc I think they have the most to gain out of the major auto manufacturers during the transition to EV. They are building charging network, which still has its growing pains, they’re actually rolling EVs, their cyberpunk truck doesn’t look ridiculous and will appeal to more people..etc.  That being said, Rivian, Lucid, TSLA (duh) are leading the charge on battery tech. In 3-5 years I think contenders will start pulling away for autonomous driving instead of battery tech, partially bc solid state batteries might help level the playing field.  I think Lucid, Tesla, Daimler, and BMW might pull away as the early adopters/winners of levels 3-5 autonomy, but it’s still hard to tell.  This is just my current take, someone please set me straight if I’m off base here.  I currently have bull call spreads on Ford with a long call to run.  Looking to buy puts on RIVN when the time is right bc I fell asleep on the call buy button at launch.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qvybd6/fords_shares_in_rivian_thats_sells_no_cars_now/hkzx19i/)

"&gt; it changes it somewhat due to the higher premiums someone would need to pay for borrowing the shares necessary for shorting during a bear market since shorting is in higher demand.

I agree that they would be paying more in that case, however I'm not aware of the exact proportions so it may not be that significant but either way I'm sure this is something they've factored into their strategy.

&gt; more to the point: Gates would have had to keep posting collateral many many times to keep his short position open as TSLA kept getting pumped. And if he did indeed opened his shorts at pre-COVID prices, there's still a long long longgg way to go before he makes a profit on that position. most financial advisors would have urged him to close his shorts.

Yeah, but Gates opening shorts that early is a massive assumption to make because Tesla was not considered overvalued at $300, which is his reasoning for shorting in the first place.

&gt; all this can be somewhat verified with Tesla's short volume. it's relatively low compared to what it should be for a company that has a market cap more than every other major car manufacturer in the US combined + has miniscule market share + miniscule production capability.

I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make here, this is precisely why it's overvalued and a perceived lack of shorts doesn't necessarily mean that it should be at that price. The likelihood is that institutional investors recognise that the stock price doesn't entirely reflect the company's value and therefore is a risky investment due to external factors (hype driving price up etc). 

&gt; and if the thinking is that Gates opened his shorts post-COVID, there are sooo many better companies to short other than Tesla.

I don't see how you're making this argument, this is completely irrelevant because you can short more than one thing at a time. It's very likely that he has a wide range of long and short positions in dozens of companies.

&gt; Half the companies that IPO'd between 2020-2022 would be good short candidates if they had enough volume for shorting to be allowed.

Again, I'm not sure what point you're making here. You can short as many times as you like, shorting has a 1:1 buy/sell ratio (borrow and sell to a buyer aka 1 sell and 1 buy, then purchase from seller aka 1 buy and 1 sell, and return) so it has nothing to do with volume.

&gt; besides, i believe it's only rumors that Gates actually shorted TSLA and that rumor started before the post-COVID Tesla pump, so this is obviously heavy speculation.

I believe Gates himself has confirmed he has a half-billion short on Tesla based on the fact it was absolutely overvalued at $1000+ which is when he spoke about it, I'm out atm so can't find source but if you can't find one on Google just lmk and I'll see if I can get one for you.",positive
"Altogether, my extended family owns about 220K shares of LCID. We bought the first batch at 12, and a lot more at 20-22 after we visited its studio and also understand more about its engineering &amp; product from our cousin, who works for Lucid's engineering. 

Stocks of all tech/grow companies are always volatile in their early days. Probably very few people here remember or personal experience, but in less than 10 years ago, companies like AAPL, NVDA, or AMD were all borderline belly up, while stalwarts like IBM, MOT, INTC or NOK seem to be ready to dominate the world for decades to come.  

We always invest based on the products &amp; management team that we did the study on - mostly tech &amp; finance. It's not always smooth, but over time, the rewards have been very fulfilling. Many of our stocks 3-10X (some of our friends seen 100x or more). Our only mistake was missing out of going in large on TSLA in its early days. 

So yes, we think Lucid would continue to be super volatile in the near term, but based on what we know &amp; learn about the companies, it will further elevate the EV revolution, and shareholders will be rewarded in the long run.

I view the perceived ""rush"" toward JNJ, KO, COST as reflecting a desire to invest not in value stocks, but in consumer staples that might fare better in a recession than stocks in other sectors would.](/r/stocks/comments/uoxxe4/ko_and_other_value_stocks_are_overvalued/i8hohbd/)

[Good luck to you,  but, just remember that as far as I know leap puts aren't inflation adjusted.   Companies with pricing power can keep growing nominal  earnings keeping up with inflation.   KO could easily be another 10% higher a year from now just due to inflation alone.   I do own 100 shares of KO that I bought in February of 2021 and I admit I almost sold them a month ago when they hit $66 (limit sell didn't fill).  The difference is I don't think they will go down,  I just had my eye on a better opportunity.   Also,  KO is more of a re-opening play than just a staple.  The fell much more than PEP during the shutdown because PEP had more consumer brands,  but KO makes bundles on stadium stuff (sports and concerts).  Right now demand for that stuff is still really high.  That demand might fall over the next year, but they will likely make quite a bit between now and then.](/r/stocks/comments/uoxxe4/ko_and_other_value_stocks_are_overvalued/i8ih1mk/)

[Anything with high gross profit margins, good double digit growth with a strong moat, and a price/sales in the single digits / low teens historically has been a good buy.  Most mature tech companies with high margins trade around a 5-6 price/sales. It's not hard to see how a high growth company with with say 30% YoY rev growth could grow into a valuation like that.  My two fav are probably SHOP &amp; ABNB as they fit this criteria perfectly, but I think U, NET and SNOW are probably good buys too, I just feel a little less comfortable with their valuations given the risk environment we're in right now. At the moment I only want to buy high conviction stocks and feel these have room to come down quite a bit more.  UPST is more speculative but an interesting company that I'm eyeing an entry in. I don't particularly like the lending business and I'm sceptical about applying AI to lending (and just AI companies generally), but the team are literally geniuses. Listening to Paul Gu speak reminds me of how I felt about TSLA and Elon in 2012.

[&gt; Is UPST even AI or just Machine Learning based on analysis of data?  Machine learning is a branch of AI.  &gt; I don’t really see what they offer that any corporate banking client couldn’t offer going forward  To be honest the main thing that makes me hesitate about UPST is that I don't really understand their moat well enough.  From what I understand they're partnering with smaller banks who likely wouldn't be able to build something similar themselves. And another thing you need to consider is how risk adverse banks are. There's a reason they've been using FICO scores for so long for example. There's probably some value in UPST's models simply because of their relative maturity and the fact they've been used with success by other banks. Sure, a well capitalise bank or another startup could come along and do the same thing, but there is an inherent risk in adopting that model because of the unknowns and lack of maturity. And of course, there's also the development costs.  Finally if UPST's risk models are actually better then competitor models then it makes sense to adopt UPST's models because it means banks can lower their risk and can charge more competitive rates on loans.  My impression is that as long as UPST's pricing is competitive and their models can perform better than any competitors it just makes sense for most banks to partner with them. But this isn't an industry I know well and those who work in the industry seem split on what they're doing. Two of the major criticisms I've seen is that no bank just uses FICO scores anyway and that they're skeptical around whether AI will ever be able to replace human judgement.](/r/stocks/comments/ubje4r/favorite_highriskhighreward_stocks/i6928cd/)

[I get where you're coming from in terms of Graham/Buffet valuation method.   Although I don't think Buffett would have much interest in T/WBD in particular since Buffett was pretty well known for saying that he didn't like the telecom business AND has been quoted saying that he wouldn't invest in bad management which is what T was (pretty much an ape that did nothing would have done better than Stephenson and Stankey with their shit deals).  Tougher to say how he'll feel about WBD. On one hand it does have the IPs foils to DIS, but they lack the delivery platform, cash, existing eco-system, brand strength, and synergy with physical properties. I think WBD spinoff as well as Dish network sale were clearly Stankey moves to fix Stephenson's fuckups. WBD is loaded with debt now and setup to be acquired by a larger streaming player or megacap tech/corp to merge with their own properties or streaming ambitions. Buffett might recognize the IP value but might wary of buying in due to lack of actual operational profits, weak outlook, acquisition setup, AND disgusting debt ridden balance sheet.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ua85ir/mickey_mouse_leads_an_army_thats_larger_and_more/i5wfqi6/)

[Anything with high gross profit margins, good double digit growth with a strong moat, and a price/sales in the single digits / low teens historically has been a good buy.  Most mature tech companies with high margins trade around a 5-6 price/sales. It's not hard to see how a high growth company with with say 30% YoY rev growth could grow into a valuation like that.  My two fav are probably SHOP &amp; ABNB as they fit this criteria perfectly, but I think U, NET and SNOW are probably good buys too, I just feel a little less comfortable with their valuations given the risk environment we're in right now. At the moment I only want to buy high conviction stocks and feel these have room to come down quite a bit more.  UPST is more speculative but an interesting company that I'm eyeing an entry in. I don't particularly like the lending business and I'm sceptical about applying AI to lending (and just AI companies generally), but the team are literally geniuses. Listening to Paul Gu speak reminds me of how I felt about TSLA and Elon in 2012.

"UAW jobs that pay on average \~40% higher than Tesla's assembly line jobs.  \~$28/hr vs \~$19.91/hr according to INDEED-dot-com. However TSLA assembly line workers get stock options and with the rising value of TSLA shares, it makes up for the lower wage. Only problem is 10-15 years from now will the stock still be climbing as rapidly as it is now?  What happens happens if it falls in a few years as the p/e ratio is bonkers.  

Also I wonder as a thought experiment if a UAW worker invested the $8/hr difference in TSLA stocks for their 401K plan would they be better off than a TSLA assembly line worker taking advantage of stock options?",positive
"True, though it didn't start out that way.

At the start of 2011, my portfolio was 100% Index funds and ETFs.  I began accumulating TSLA shares that year, and ended up around 92-93% Index funds/ETFs, and 7-8% TSLA.

I never sold any of my TSLA shares, although I did add a small amount of TSLA stock from time to time over the next decade.

The overwhelming majority of my invested capital since 1997 has gone into Index investments.

However, my TSLA shares did so well (now worth about 190x the initial investment amount), that the growth eclipsed the rest of my portfolio by a substantial margin.

I knew from past observation that I didn't need to invest a huge % of my portfolio into a high risk/reward stock in order to grow the level of wealth that I hoped to achieve.  And if it didn't work out, I knew that my Index funds were likely to provide enough gains over several decades

Edit:

Wanted to add that I made the deliberate choice to **avoid** using margin and to **avoid** any options.

Many of my colleagues at Tesla Motors Club made big gains on options in 2013, and subsequently lost much of those gains during TSLA's period of sideways trading between 2014-2019.

Options take away the investor's advantage of time, and margin places one at the mercy of the broker (who can and will raise margin requirements at the worst times).  I like to keep my advantages, so I **avoid** both margin and options.",positive
"It was $3M, and TSLA made it get there pretty quick. At the time I threw everything in Roth without thinking too much, and it turns out Roth is bad for early retirement (great for retirement age people though).

[So. I understand your point. I'll just give you a real life example because it's easier to explain. I only trade stocks that have long term potential, but I intentionally keep extra money in my account to swing and buy dips.

When SOFI hit 20.00 I sold and collected some profits. Now I also own PYPL. PYPL was down to 240 shortly after sofi peaked so I reinvested into PYPL.

Let's say I only get $5000 loan with my $10k (soon to be 20k) shack as collateral. I make my taco shop, it takes a while to grow, but the sandwich shop is now worth $20k. Now I only need to sell 25% of my shack to close out the loan and be happy. 

What did the lender get from this:

- More or less safe loan because the shack was worth 2x the loan amount, so pretty much a guarantee that they would be made whole
- Some interest, but less than the 100% that I made (because they didn't truly think the shack would 2x so would rather have guaranteed gains)

What did I get from this:

 - 100% gains on my sandwich shack which grew (I had trust it would grow at a faster rate than the loan's interest rate)
 - Didn't have to sell my shack at 'half price'
 - Also raised capital to start up the taco shop
 - The interest I paid was tax deductible so I get to 'save' a little bit here

At its core this is what these billionaires are doing- they take out loans to fund their fun ventures so they can fly to mars/space/whatever. These are business loans from what I recall (sorry, have a meeting in a bit so I can't google, but IIRC the interest is deductible from cap gains) so they have some tax advantage, but they're essentially saying that the growth rate of AMZN/TSLA is higher than the interest rate. Which... yeah, obviously. But it's also a risky growth (what is TSLA even at now?), so the risk averse lender might prefer a low interest rate loan. 

This is also pretty much exactly what a loan is for. The only difference is that they're using their massive tech stocks as collat, and that is contentious. But I doubt people would be as concerned if Bezos was taking out a second mortgage on his billion dollar moon base.

I agree there are fundamental issues with what's currently happening, but I don't think a wealth tax is the way to go.",positive

"I've just bought several pairs to test out (Joomra, Tsla, Whitin, Xero, and even Fitkicks). I'm still waiting for some of them to arrive, but I've gotten the Joomra's and my first impression is that they're really good for the price. They look like perfectly normal shoes, and fit my wide feet very well. The insoles, which have a small amount of arch support, are removable (though my arches are soo high that I don't feel them either way). The upper is just a mesh knit - it seems sturdy enough for a casual/walking shoe, but I'm not sure how long it would hold up as a running shoe.

I also got the TSLA Vapor Glove knockoffs, and they'd probably do much better as running/workout shoes. They're pretty ugly though, if I'm being honest.

The Whitins are supposed to arrive in the next couple days and I'll probably do a longer comparison either here or as its own post, since I haven't seen much of anything about the Joomras so far on this sub.",positive

"Good, glad to hear you're familiar with channels. You didn't have them on your original chart, but they are definitely one of the better tools when used correctly. I use them as well, although only as part of BMA, not as trade signals.

And no, of course you don't buy every dip. My point was merely that people seem to only know the ""buy the dip"" part and forget the ""sell the rally"" part, which was exactly what TSLA holders should have done AFTER seeing the trend breaks in early-mid Dec: Sell the next rally. Instead, most seem to only sell when they cannot take more pain.

Now, some of the best trades are in fact counter trend, but one obviously needs something more than trend lines for that or they'll just be catching falling knives. That's for another post.

"I studied TSLA for almost year now. Fundamentals are great in my eyes and the only bad point was P/E. It didn't feel right.
But when you look at the growth target of about 50%, the actual growth of about 70% right now and then you look at the calculation of the ""standard"" P/E you will recognize that this number isnt that meaningful for a growth company. With every new quarterly earning announcement TSLA halfs it's P/E. So I think a better indicator would be forward/annualized P/E -&gt; take the EPS from current quarter with current share price. There's no way that TSLA makes less EPS in the upcoming quarters in my eyes. So, annualized EPS is more meaningful. And this number is not so crazy as it seems. About 120 when considering Q3.",positive

Holy God!

So what happened to all the people who talk about holding TSLA long term and not worrying?

I mean historically, long term Tesla has done well (even in a year's time frame.)  But lately it's been dropping from all time highs like crazy and I'm totally demoralized.

Like does anyone know based perhaps a bit on historic trends... Like what we are likely going to see Tesla do in the coming months?  I know Q1 and Q2 are historically weak for Tesla... But with two new Gigas underway, is there any glimmer of hope that things can improve and before April we might be back up above $1100?

Would love to get some perspective on where people think Tesla will be in the coming months. I mean... Like all you fine folks, I'm trying to be long term and not look at the stock price month after month but these days it seems next to impossible not to be a bit concerned?

What do you all think... And I would love to get some reactions from longer term investors.

Thank you all!",positive

"Tesla has $18B cash. I estimate they will generate another $14B in 2022, $22B in 2023, $40B in 2024, $80B in 2025. Tesla is adding $1B per month now and will soon increase to $2B per month.

Building Giga Austin the factory only cost $1.1B, add another billion for machines. Then the factory becomes self sustaining. Same for Giga Shanghai.

There is no way Tesla can find ways to invest all the money and get super high returns. If they could, they wouldn't have kept $18B in the bank and earning 1% a year.

The question becomes keeping $10B cash in the bank or keeping $10B of TSLA shares on the book. 

However, if they are waiting for a big recession then use the cash to buy mining companies, I think that would be a good way to spend the money.",positive

"See. This is where your bias shows.

Which metric, apart from gut instinct, shows that Tesla's value is within the realm of fairness?

&gt;TSLA is trading at a P/E of 113.81, a P/S of 15.38, and a 142.52x multiple on its FCF. The numbers are drastically inflated as TSLA has no business trading at a larger P/S multiple than AMZN, which trades at 11.31 P/S when it has grown its revenue by $341.76 billion over the previous 3.25 years compared to TSLA's $40.73 billion of revenue growth. TSLA has generated $6.93 billion in FCF over the TTM, while Mr. Market has placed a 142.52x multiple on TSLA due to $7.15 billion FCF growth over the past 3.25 years. FB trades at a 15.19x FCF multiple while growing FCF by $23.45 billion over this period which is more than 3x what TSLA has generated in
 the TTM.

(From seeking alpha)

&gt;Yes, the tenant trashing the property is a risk, but generally if you buy in high class neighborhoods that's not a significant risk. Also picking something that happens in rare situations and saying that's a reason not to do something isn't a valid argument. By that logic we wouldn't drive because it risks loss of everything. We can get statistics for risk and make logical inferences based on those statistics. Obviously nothing is guaranteed, and if you want to use a reductionist argument to say everything with risk is speculation then you have removed all forms of meaning from the word because then I'm speculating I won't die every time I walk down the stairs.

Just remember the last bull market happened when PE was just 8… which is a 12.5% earnings yield. Now Sp500 is 25 PE and earnings yield is just 4%. It’s all going to come down and there mega caps will come down harder.  FYI Google 100 year performance of large cap growth vs. small cap value stocks. $1 in 1930 grew to $100,000 by 2014 in small cap value. But $1 in large cap growth only grew to $1900 in 2014.  Everybody goes for large cap growth because they just follow and can’t pick winners and those sexy names just don’t have sexy returns once large.  Buffet bought AAPL @ $15 and PE of 10.  Those are the prices to get rich at not MSFT $260… lol](/r/stocks/comments/uqhu31/anybody_else_just_buying_msft/i8t006q/)

[To circle back… this conversation was specifically about someone wanting AAPL and MSFT. In other words, not wanting the other 60%. VGT was suggested specifically for heavy exposure in those two stocks.   Personally, I’m more into ETFs than picked stocks. My challenge was relative to the perspective of someone who wanted only MSFT and AAPL. Within that context, VGT isn’t as close to the mark as simply buying the two stocks.](/r/stocks/comments/uqhu31/anybody_else_just_buying_msft/i8suar0/)

[I predict the bottom is already in except for the last few bubbles like TSLA and cryptos.  Putin has lost and is terminally ill, for one.  he cannot sustain this war much longer and cold be deposed or killed.  At best he will be a cancer patient on powerful meds and very weak needing 12 hours of sleep a day. if he has blood cancer he is likely dead soon, and if he gets covid that could kill him.  Plus Finland-Sweden joining NATO shatters Putin's delusions of grandeur. A united Nordic front alone could defeat Russia in a war, even without the US and the rest of NATO, and now even Turkey, China and India are clamming up and refusing to back Putin.  So if that war ends and the good guys win, oil will drop $30 and the Fed might put the brakes on rate hikes.  Plus the China covid shutdown will end any day now. That alone is worth a 10% pop for AAPL and AAPL always leads the market back from these severe selloffs.](/r/stocks/comments/uqmo1q/the_stock_market_is_on_a_6week_losing_streak_how/i8tjw5j/)

[""It's, in general, got little to do with the company financials at the moment. ""  Why on earth do you say that?  Morningstar's ""fair value"" on NVDA is $200, so even now it's a ""hold"" stock by their measure.    AAPL is even worse, still trading above the fair value estimate of $130.    Beyond that inflation is about company fundamentals, because as prices rise people look for ways to cut back, and the end of the pandemic is about company fundamentals, because people are going to go to movies and restaurants again instead of spending all their money on home hobbies and NFLX and You Tube.    GOOG got whacked on You Tube advertising and in case you haven't noticed, the number of adds has gone way up just in the last few months - which means there are fewer viewers for more adds, which means pricing is going to fall.  AMZN is already feeling that paid too, and all the companies that sell web services and digital hardware are going to feel it, including NVDA.   NVDA won't see $300 again for a few years.  Morningstar gives AMZN strong buy rating (five star) but I wouldn't buy it.  I don't see AMZN stock making much headway for a few years either.

I like the longer term time frames for all my analysis because it allows to see the longer term theme of the markets. I find that context really valuable as I don’t want to be fighting the trend on these pattern breakouts. I also find that daily time frame pattern breakouts tend to give you that right pop on breakout and I can get more consistent follow through. That helps me justify the less than ideal spreads on some of these names. I pretty much only day trade. I don’t hold much overnight. So I just sit and wait for these patterns to trigger and then look to play them. I use the shorter time frames to quantify the relative strength in the run up to the move and then use that info to filter out bad looking setups. 

I trade five core names otherwise. Spy, qqq, appl, tsla, MSFT. And I play those with a 5 or 6 different types of strategies and am happy to play those names with intraday patterns or setups because the option spreads are tight and justifiable",positive

"If you are willing to pay to keep your shares, it may be worth the risk.  Only you can decide.   TSLA may yet go down, or may not.

The general advice is to sell out of the money calls at 30 delta.   

This is so that you gain upon unexpected rise in the stock, and to  sell no longer than 60 days out, because most theta decay occurs in the final weeks of an option's life.    

Never sell calls on stock you want to keep.

Longer expirations result in marginally small greater value and less trader flexibility, and long expirations  can commit you to being  a long term bag holder of an undesirable position.  

Do all of your options gains on TSLA so far, surpass the cost of paying to keep the stock?  

That is Sept 2022, right?

[You're on the right track, but using incorrect numbers.  Tesla's PE after Q4 will be ~150. If you annualize Q4 it'll be 76-91. If you consider the expected growth it'll be a forward PE of 60-70.  That puts them at a PEG ratio of around 1 (probably even lower, considering their earnings growth was much higher than their 70% revenue growth last year and will probably continue to be so for another 1-3 years).  A PEG of 1 for a company as innovative and with so much untapped TAM (energy, solar, robotaxis, AI, etc.) is really cheap.  &gt; It would take 5 years of 50% CAGR for TSLA to achieve a more humble PE ration of 40x &gt; It would take 7 years of 50% CAGR for TSLA to achieve a reasonable valuation &lt;17x  I don't know what math you're using to arrive to that conclusion, but that's obviously wrong as you can tell from the math I shared above.  &gt; I don't need to conduct a DCF analysis to look at the market, the growth, and know that the assumptions underlying TSLA's growth exist somewhere between Hogwarts and Narnia.

[Even with their green energy products they should not be valued at more than 400 billion max, especially since the cars are the main business and they are about to get massive competition.  GM just announced a 6 billion investment in EV cars to try and dethrone Tesla as #1 in that space.  This reminds me of Netflix. They had the big headstarter and huge multiple based on the fact that for years they had little competition, but now the competition is starting to eat their lunch.    It is therefore not a sure thing that TSLA can continue growing much and in this market climate when all the high fliers are being taken to the woodshed, watch out below for TSLA unless they can knock it out of the park on multiple fronts, and even then they still don't deserve a 100-300 PE.

Then I started to think maybe I could sell out before it hit bottom. Turns out I sold out at the exact fucking bottom before these assholes using Covid relief funds (aka SLR) bought up everything in sight. Naturally, as Covid news got worse I thought it made no sense and waited and waited to buy back my beloved shares. Ultimately, I didn’t buy back until it was too late.

"First, thanks for the PSA. I'm going to bookmark this for future RH question reference.

Second, the reason one might want a DNE is because one might not be able to afford an exercise by exception. Sure, it could be profitable if exercised but that doesn't mean you can necessarily do it.

Third, I'm glad they called out that their risk management takes priority. So if they see you don't have the $100k needed for an exercise by exception on an ITM call on TSLA, they will close the position, even if you put a DNE on it. So in other words, **the DNE is not a get out of jail card vs. RH's extremely conservative risk management of ITM positions**.",positive

Movements in TSLA seemed to be a leading indicator for GME price movements today and they would appear to be have been well correlated at a glance. Has anybody run the numbers or think it's worth looking into? Was this happening market-wide?,positive
"You do realize most people have exposure to Tesla stock right? It's in many major indices. And yet, we can all still looks at the numbers and see it is over valued. 

Also you can't just say number, TSLA isn't estimated to be at a 100 p/e ratio until 2024. Who says? Tesla themselves by their own estimates and PEG ratio. For this company to get to a realistic valuation they'll have to continue this apce of growth for 6-10 years. And in 6-10 years their market share will have fallen radically. People don't just hate Tesla, we can like it and still see the glaring problems that are leading to a bubble.",positive
"&gt; not really, I posted a question after doing some serious research on few stocks

You have a venn diagram problem.  There are 4000 publicly traded companies, you've picked 3 of those companies which you've seriously researched and are asking for someone that's both seriously researched the same companies and has experience doing DDs to comment on them.

The number of people that fit in that category are simply small (unless you are talking about a meme stock like TSLA, in which case you'll just get ""It's overvalued and no better than gambling"")

Saying ""Just do VTI"" is really just a lazy answer that is generally applicable to anyone.  Frustrating, yes, but also not insane which is why those answers will get highly upvoted.",positive
"Here’s the rule at r/stocks:

If people are jumping on board certain stocks in masses it’s too late. They like to buy stocks when they feel safe after a big run up. (BRK.B, costco, Microsoft).

[TXN might merit some interest as well for sure. Yes they have higher margins, but their level of growth and their valuation does not really merit a place in my semiconductor portfolio. Frankly, there are so many good companies in this industry that it is incredibly hard to limit yourself to a handful.  In regards to the fund, Intel is also making a play for it (see link). Come 10 years there is a real chance that Intel might become a real contender again as they seek to take on AMD, NVDA and TSM at the same time.

[The EUV litography machines ASML assembles for TSM and Samsung are kind of like the planes the duopoly of Boeing and Airbus build. ASML has many different suppliers they source parts from - for example - Carl Zeiss ($CZMWY) who manufacture the lenses. And just like the planes these EUV lithography machines are about the size of a mini van to a small school bus, with many moving parts that needs to be shipped separately via air cargo and assembled on-site at the foundry. Essentially these are very complicated and intricate machines that required years of R&amp;D and investing from ASML's end and the only other company that could be close to considered second in this space is Intel.](/r/stocks/comments/pcf16a/is_the_semiconductorprocessor_industry_nvda_amd/hajui6g/)

[None right now, 1-2 years is too long for me to keep things locked up. I’m what they call Paper Handed.   I liquidated my positions in TSM late last year, and AMD recently.   I saw them both as very solid companies with great fundamentals and up-trending forecasted earnings. I haven’t looked into them recently though.   But TSM has the highest market cap (least susceptible to price volatility) in the sector (I believe), and pays a decent dividend as well, like 1.5%.   The sector “blue chip” is INTC, I guess. Some believe their time has passed technology-wise, and they may be right, but they won’t go belly up anytime soon. And they pay a decent dividend of like 2.5%.   NVDA is top of the pops technology-wise from what I’ve heard but honestly I don’t know, semiconductors don’t interest me, money does. So I’m not familiar with the tech. Either way they have a massive market cap too, so that can sometimes imply relative safety from volatility.   And then there’s a bunch of smaller high-risk options, SMCI, INDI, CRSR, XLNX, etc. I’d look into those individually if you’re interested.  MY ONLY ADVICE:  Be very wary about what you read on Reddit. You can never trust the motivation of anyone who’s talking about a “sure buy” or a “guaranteed 10X”.   Do your own research, and godspeed.](/r/stocks/comments/pcr7gr/is_it_worth_to_invest_5000_in_index_funds_for_12/hamh0pm/)

Shorts buy shares to ladder stock down then cover.  Their algo's do the math and rather than just covering they burn money buying the stock then dumping it to crash the stock price and trigger SL and force paperhands to panic sell,  If you diamond handed through these manipulation moves you would of saw the shorts cover and that drove the price up to higher highs sometimes causing a halt up   this was phenomenal to witness the shorts get rekt so hard.](/r/stocks/comments/pcrc9t/sprt_is_up_almost_200_in_a_single_day_anyone_know/hamkkhs/)

"[I know. Since I don't want to write it down in detail, but since I got a minute, I'll detail here. Buckle up.   In theory, unlimited or infinite profit can only happen in stock when it goes up. But if it's always going up, we're bound to inflation. So there must be two ways to make profits. Short strategy was legalized in 1937. But there's a catch. You can only short when the price goes up. You cannot short if the stock price keeps diving, the mechanism that allows to protect company potential and excessive speculation. But we know that over time, it disappears and shorting can be done indefinitely.   In a theory of energy conservation, there's only a constant energy but the energy transforms. If the market is limited with those brokers and market makers, if someone makes a profit, there must be others who lost their money. It's the conservation of money supply in the market. However in order to attract external investment or (DCA for retailer), market makers need to give a little sometimes back to retailers. So retailers or some call it retards here in wsb dump their hourly wages or salary to the market.   If there's a supply, there must be someone raking up those supplies. In a well known case that Goldman Sachs, one of the big IBs always make profits 85% of the time consistently. Remember GS is also one of the market makers (MM). If the economy is down, GS will still make profit. How so? It's because of 2 ways streets that were created even before our grandparents were born, i.e., Shorting.   In 21st century, retailers can easily invest at the tip of their fingers and all the information available in web. What is the advantages that those MM can wield to make profit?   Traditionally, if the company can make $1 per outstanding share, their share is only worth at $1 (Simply saying). Whoever likes to pay more than $1 is banking on the potential of the company profits down the road and profitability of the company in the near future. So PE ratio gets inflated over time.   If the PE ratio is set in stone, retailers have the advantage over MMs or those IBs. One the ratio hits 20, retailers can stop buying shares. But in reality it is not. By making the PE ratio varies between different companies and in different times, MMs hold the ultimate power over retailers when to screw those retards and when to give them a little so that their DCA will keep coming into the market.   That's how IBs, got rich. There's nothing sophisticated about ultra intelligent bankers. They produce nothing. They just create a wave, the wave that most of the retailers cannot predict and only insiders know when to dump, i.e., short or hold the stock.   The rest are just for entertainment purpose, such as price target. Yes, when they want to pump the stock, all IBs, GS, Morgan Stanley, BoA, etc raised the PT so that retailers can be hopeful. Once the PT is reached, dump.   Of course, you'd wonder when they'd be dumping once the price hits the ATH (All time high)? It's the insider tactics. That's why I said earlier, when I talked about this, no one likes to hear it.   What does it to do with TSLA. TSLA is another tulip mania in the US.   To make it short, in order to pump money into something, you need some tangible entity. US keeps complaining about China this and China that, but in reality China is the biggest economy and MADE in CHINA is more common in your home and mine than our official name printed in our houses.   So MM cannot pump their forever darlings stock when in reality those stocks might represents nothing but a piece of paper, eg, Hertz. So they need some darling stocks and TSLA represents a good one.   You know why? SpaceX has a deal with US military. So there's a green light to pump TSLA and include it in SPX within a short span of time. Of course those happens only after Elon SpaceX successfully launched. Otherwise, TSLA will forever be under water.   Of course, you can say this is all pure fantasy or conspiracy.   We all know why Pelosi bought deep ITM TSLA calls way back.

NYSE:PM / 9

[Recently my A+ short setup has been a first Green Day all day fade. My setups don’t have a list of requirements, but its more of a feel and look thing. I look for a full day of accumulation, a gap up post market, a lot of exhaustion premarket and then look to enter after PM highs are retested and fail. When they do fade, they fade hard. If you want a good example, $INTC did this perfectly on 12/7/21. Typically only trade lower floats but this seems to translate well given the setup is there.

[I'm Canadian too and started on WS but later realized that their hidden fees for anything not Canadian is pretty substantial... My Advice for you is this..  1. Open a TFSA on WealthSimple (If you are already using a TFSA then don't worry about these steps) 2. Sell all your Long Hold Canadian Positions from your Personal Account and rebuy them right away into your TFSA.. you should also keep any Canadian stock you own on WS, it is great for that. 3. Open an account somewhere else, Questrade is an ok next step up trading platform, but my reco would be Interactive Brokers (Its easy and free, their trading fees are great and you can trade from 4am - 9pm) 4. Which ever platform you go with open a regular account and a TFSA, once that is done, transfer all your non Canadian stocks off of WS.. thy should do this for free, but don't quote me on that. 5. The next thing and this is a game changer =... GO REALTIME DATA.. 15 min delayed data is a handicap if you're serious about trading. you can pay for RT data on Questrade and IBKR.. 6. Tradingview is awesome and totally worth the investment if you plan on trading a lot. IBKR's charts on their web app runs off of the Tradingview platform so no real need to subscribe to it if you go with IBKR, that is if you are just looking for basic charting. 7. Learn how to read the MacD, RSI, EMA indicators to start. they will change your whole game. once you learn how to read charts you can stop looking to reddit and other place for your DD.. Indicators and charts will start telling you everything you need to know and then doing some of your own quick DD will confirm things for you. However its always good to keep your ear to the ground, so Reddit and other places are good but should never be the place you get your DD from, do your own always. 8. Scanners are great if you are trading a lot.. Low Float/High Volume = something to watch on any given day.. but be careful they can also help set you up to fail and do so a lot. 9. Learn to watch the market... It opens 3 times everyday.. Premarket actually opens up at 4am.. the pre market opens up again for most people at 7am.. then the market actually opens up at 9:30am.. And this should also answer the question ""Is the Stoke Market Manipulated?"" if you can learn to watch what happens to a stock during these pre market sessions then you can figure out pretty easy which ones are being set up to steal your money.. its all pretty clear if you just spend the time to look. The % you see next to a stock actually starts calculating from the close of the previous day.. so the MM's have all of the AH session and the 2 PreMarket Session to set you up to steal your money.. so if you ever wondered ""Why did I buy a stock at 9:30am that was showing so many signs of running and making me rich, that had everyone saying this is gonna be huge, Mooning in PM etc... well why did it tank on open....   Cause it was designed to do that.. 10. STAY AWAY FROM Penny Stocks, unless you believe in it.. but honestly.. Stay Away from Penny Stocks.. They are 90% of the time garbage and/or Scams.  Those are my 10 Stocking Stuffers for ya.. Hope it Goes well for you. Go RAPTORS!!](/r/StockMarket/comments/rmlf8g/looking_for_a_bit_of_advice_as_a_small_time/hpw3xm1/)

[First off, nothing was explained.  Secondly, PayPal just spent 45 billion on a website that, once it's blatantly monetized, will be trying to channel consumers towards various products. Just like Google sells ads. Just like Gmail captures targeted info and search data about what products services people are trying to purchase.  Oh wait, or is that facebooks business model they are stealing, because FB helps use customer search data and personal data to sell targeted ads too. They even link directly to sites that sell the products you might want.  Or was that Amazon's business model? I forgot whose business model was being copied, over produced, and monetized by turning customer behavior, into links to sell ads/products.  The thing is this: this is just market oversaturation. PayPal/Pinterest aren't ""the end all super app"". They're just another asshole company trying to oversaturate a market with consumers that are going to stop using the service after an initial excited period. If this goes well, it will be a flash in the pan, and twenty more other companies are going to show up trying to increase profits on Etsy, Houzz, rover.com, care.com, and any other number of other goods/services companies out there. I give them 5 quarters until they realize they won't be able to change consumer behavior significantly enough to recoup their losses.  This is obvious market oversaturation just as much as consumers are sick of having more than 3-4 streaming services.   I like PayPal for their Fintech and p2p products.

NYSE:GM / 32

[I actually disagree here.  Do I think TSLA is overpriced?  Yeah on current fundamentals.  But I think good EV competition is **good** for Tesla because it proves they were RIGHT - it's actually a confirmation of the bull case.  More EVs on the market will bring more EV infrastructure (in which Tesla is currently #1) and more opportunity for wider implementation and acceptance.  For example, I could see some Interstates being retrofitted with wireless charging pads in the asphalt so your EV actually charges while you drive.  Imagine if Ford, GM, and other big brands all jumped on the bandwagon here... and what that could do for Tesla's long-haul truck aspirations (on top of their popular cars).  Imagine having AI-only lanes (like HOV) where the cars could drive within a few feet from each other at high speeds because they are centralized on a network and able to respond to dangers miles ahead (much further than human eyes).  Tesla is certainly pushing some regulatory borders here, but their Autopilot with navigation is by far some of the most advanced tech currently (widely) available.  Of course it still needs more work, but again, competition actually helps Tesla here because it will bring about more market acceptance and regulatory approval.  If Tesla were the only major player in the EV market, there's no way municipalities would take on expensive infrastructure builds to accommodate EVs.  But with so many companies committing to EV strategy, I think it's only natural that these imaginative ideas start making their way into mainstream conversation and, one day, building plans.  Yes, I think Tesla's valuation is incredibly optimistic.  But if the bear case is that some Mach-E sales are going to put a dent in Tesla sales, I think people are vastly underestimating the wave of change that Tesla is pushing and seemingly winning.](/r/StockMarket/comments/qfngrp/take_a_look_at_this_chart_of_tesla_since_2020_to/hi2d4jr/)

[Maybe, maybe not. If you mean FB publicly representing it as a quick transition that will save their enterprise value, you’re (probably) right.

This transition is already happening, not just with gamers, but anyone with a cell phone. Imagine leaving your cell phone at home, you probably would feel like you left a limb. Could you imagine that 5-10 years ago?  These transitions will happen much faster than people can currently comprehend.

"Since this is r/stocks and not r/VOO I’ll give you a different answer.

What fields/companies do you know about/personally believe in? For example, if you’re a big believer of tech, maybe go for AMD , NVDA, TSLA, MSFT, etc. 

If you’re less into tech and more into something speculative like biotech (which I am personally a big fan of), throw some money at it. With anything speculative though, make sure you’re using play money. You only invest what you’re willing to lose anyway, but with stuff less set in stone like biotech, the odds are against you but the upside is larger than something safer, if that makes sense. 

Basically, invest in what you personally believe in, not what others tell you is good. If you know a lot about a field and believe it has great importance for the future and there are companies already listed, go for it. As always though be safe and be ready to ride the waves, because there WILL be waves and sometimes it’s extremely turbulent",positive
"The only way to do that is if you directly register your shares. Let's say you get your stacks of money and place an order for 16M shares, then bam, nothing happens, shares continue to be traded normally. That's because Market Markers must provide liquidity, so if someone wants to buy WISH but you have all the shares, they will naked short it (internalize) to provide liquidity. Also, your 16M buy order will probably end up in a dark pool and won't even affect the stock price (what probably happened to TSLA recently). As a result, the synthetic shares paired with dark pool transactions will make the stock price tank, since the company value is now diluted in a larger number of shares and your buy pressure was negated.

"[Some key points that I learnt the hard way:  1. Don't try to time the market.  2. Set price targets.   For example I had a price target for NIO at 55 and sold when it did. It hurt a bit seeing it climb all the way to the ath, but I stayed strong and bough again at 35.   3. Frequently review the risk of your stocks.  The risk changes when they climb. Reevaluate the likelyhood of each stock to climb higher and the risk of it dropping again. Adjust your decisions to the new evaluation.  4. Accept losses.  Everyone makes bad decisions once in a while. Accept it, take the loss and learn from it. That is unless you really really think it will go up again ofc.  5. Lower your overall risk with a fair share of ETFs and blue chips, maybe even some boomer stuff like gold.](/r/stocks/comments/qlotrn/i_cant_get_the_hang_of_letting_my_winners_run/hj7vxuv/)

"That day is tomorrow, because tomorrow is MOASS. Jk

In all seriousness my personal tin-foil in all of this, is that they know DRS is net+ despite all of their efforts at shakeouts and assumption that ""just like all other issues, retail will eventually forget""

They can't afford a day where Computershare goes ""we have DRS'd all the shares there are"" and have the entire market lose faith. SEC's job is to instill public trust.

Seeing as though the SEC and DOJ are making a splash after years if not decades of letting this happen, I think they might be ready to play the let the price run up to get people to sell card. I don't think they have a choice, but I may be biased and missing something.

I might be called a shill for saying it but, I can't help but think large shareholders/experienced participants will 'take profits' as we reach ATH and beyond), maybe even more than half, then by controlling the narrative afterwards via divide n conquer (""that was the squeeze bro""), idea/post suppression, seasoned with an official document showing Melvin getting margin called, someone going to jail etc etc, they just might be able to ""resolve"" this. Let the stock return to 'normal' behavior not ""hodl forever"" and ever so slowly close the remaining shorts/synthetics at which point GME rises slow and steady like TSLA did.

These +2M/yr ramps though are an immense undertaking with double Tesla's current ops being added every year.

Possible, but Tesla might also top out at 5M as competitors start filling in the BEV market this decade (my thesis prior to 2020 was that Tesla would top out at ~2M maybe but I was wrong about that apparently).

5M would be the Apple model, not a dominant immense market share but taking most of the market that has taste (and $$$ to pay for it).

&gt; there is pretty much no way to make money going these long options. The expected moves are already baked in with plenty of buffer. The only time when you can really make money with leaps is in an inactive cyclical market the market isn't paying attention to, for example, resource stocks.

Paul Pelosi (Nancy Pelosi's husband) is well known for making lots of deep ITM LEAPs trades and he's being doing well.  (and no, it doesn't take some secret insider trading to invest in Roblox or Microsoft).

The price of MSFT or AAPL in 2 years is not 'baked in'.

Back in September a 2024 TSLA LEAP @ 1000 was OTM and $14k.  Today it is ITM and $39k.

"[Is that short term trade portfolio or long term investing portfolio?  For short term trade  1. Look for catalyst like earnings or upcoming project, anything that will make it spike.  2.

In other words, size up your position.  4. Then use technical analysis to find your entry Watch 3 key things. You can use indicators or whatever but you have to find these 3 things.  1. Market structure. Is it uptrend or down or ranging.  2. Resistance and support. Where does it bounce. 3. Strength of the direction. Continuation or reversal.   If long term  1. Go to yahoo finance or whatever website that shows annual financial statements. Don’t look at quarter until you’ve actually bought in.   2. Income statement: revenue growth 7 yrs. if grows by more than 10% go to the next step. If going down, don’t buy. If all over the place (sometimes down a lot sometimes up a lot) don’t buy.   Scan thru COGS, SG&amp;A, if too high or higher than revenue don’t buy. If reasonable, next step.   Net income: if keep decreasing don’t buy.   EBIT: if too low against EBITDA, be suspicious.  Basic Shares outstanding: if increase too much, be cautious.  Market cap divided by Earnings per share: if over 20 wait to buy. Aka, don’t buy TSLA now.   Balance sheet: look at current asset and divide by current liability. If over 1, good. If too far from 1, don’t buy.   Cashflow.  Look at free cash flow (cash from operation-capital expenditure) go back to the income statement and look at their dividend pay x total outstanding shares then divide that by free cashflow if lower than 25%, good.   If all good, then buy. It’s underpriced. Then start DD. Find out about management, look at sec filings, follow Twitter, 10Qs, to DCA down. If no good news, don’t sell. If the fundamental is strong, the company will do well eventually.   Final step is write down monthly goal for your desired but realistic amounts. And how would that be probable. And how much you will cash out. How will you spend what you have cashed out. Write those down weekly or monthly. This will motivate you to levels beyond “let’s make some money.”   On how to read the financials, read interpretation of financial analysis by Mary Buffett. This book tells you every line in the statement and tells you how Warren Buffett use them.   I wrote about the fundamentals pretty excessively because stocks you are holding tells me that you don’t look at fundamentals when you buy stocks. That’s probably what you are doing wrong. You also bought SPY while we were all waiting for Fed to taper. Which also shows that you don’t have a percentage in mind for the exit. Like you don’t know how much you want to make with the stock you are holding.

[ETH and BTC are good long term holds in terms of crypto. If you really want to focus your portfolio on long term putting more money into stocks like TSLA, AMZN, FB are stocks that you know are going to go up. It’s good to take small risks like you did with NVDA which paid off. I would also change and focus on ETF’s. If your focusing on a 5 year hold I would highly recommend putting 30-35% of your portfolio into either SPY or another long term hold such as Schwab ETFs. You can do research on those if you want. It’s also important to keep around 10% of your portfolio in more risk oriented positions, which you have plenty of options already in your portfolio. Also around 5-10% in cash, in order to buy dips and quick positions. Hope this helps.](/r/StockMarket/comments/p7vx7r/position_advice/h9mr39u/)

[&gt;Oh and Tesla insurance, a non existent business segment, is valued at one fifth of insurance industry in the U.S.  As someone who consults with some of the highest profile companies in the industry, it's absolutely astonishing to me that the industry hasn't been disrupted into oblivion. I mean I'm assuming it's the mountains of paperwork and insane amount of capital required because 99% of the software in the auto insurance industry is absolute fucking dogshit. I'm talking millions of lines of code with no test coverage. Memory leaks so bad that they just schedule server reboots and load balance around it throughout the day. Still using frameworks that aren't getting security patches. New projects are using stacks that are 5+ years out of date because their devs are clock punchers and the company never pays for training. I mean obvious the valuation of TSLA in terms of insurance is insane but I'm just in disbelief in terms of the state of the industry and how they still manage to survive.](/r/stocks/comments/p7s9gj/cathie_wood_we_couldnt_be_further_away_from_a/h9mscv6/)

[My own personal thesis that I've developed through research and experience. I'm largely invested in index funds. I own SPY (17%), VTI (14%), VXUS (13%), MSFT (15%), GOOG (14%), APPL (7%), TSLA (7%), and LMT (9%). My roth account is O (50%) and SCHD (50%).  My 401K is VTI (55%) and VXUS (35%) with the rest in bonds.  I believe computers will be around for a while, large or small, so I invested in Apple and Microsoft. I also just really like Microsoft. Tesla is a yolo. Lockheed Martin because I work in DoD aerospace and have many years experience. I believe in the business model.  My weightings are tech heavy because Microsoft and Google have absolutely run on me, but I don't rebalance my portfolio. I buy what I like, but I use index funds to stay safe in the market. I know SPY overlaps with the rest of my portfolio. It's where I started investing and I just leave it.](/r/stocks/comments/p7l7i6/i_just_bought_alibaba/h9mm0zj/)

[That more and more people are opting to purchase games online digitally or they can find better physical deals online as opposed to in person? Stores have been steadily closing down and or consolidating.   People are so absent minded it's not even funny, look; check out GameStores lifetime graph, do you see how currently it's trading at 7.5-10x what it traded at its peak (you know when physical stores dominanted and there weren't many alternatives to purchasing games between 2005-2010).  Now tell me, how the fuck is Game Store even worth anywhere close to 150-200 per share nowadays as their business fails?  At the BEST of times, when they were thriving they traded at $40 15 years ago, again **AT THE BEST OF TIMES**.   Now do you understand what they would have to pulloff to be anywhere close to $150 a share at the worst of times?  Genuinely, their revenue has been on a steady decline and their sales don't even come close to justifying it's current price tag.  People may point of TSLA or other speculative industry disrupters but Game Store ain't one of those LOL.  It's funny when people forget that Game Store hype was never about the business at all, it was just a vessel to take advantage of some seriously leveraged goofs it never had anything to do with the company being solid fundamentally lmao.  Sure, they were definitely undervalued, but their actual value is between 15-40 tops.   Even if they turned everything around, and did a serious overhaul of their business strategy they still wouldn't even be worth $150 lmao.   Leverage + retarted HF =/= GOOD BUSINESS  Jesus fuck, you people are genuinely either stupid as fuck or suuuuuuper naive and gullible. The bear thesis is that the company fundamentally sucks, like if you're genuinely riding Game Store expecting it go higher because it's a *Great* company you are seriously misled. If you're still waiting for some magic squeeze, sure go for it, but if you're holding shares because you ""believe"" in GameStore you're actually fucking cooked.

"Positives: With the widths I use, it has less delta exposure and less overall risk than a standard credit spread - it also has a built in lotto ticket. We call the top put the “Guardian”. On a 14 day trade I usually get 10-20% credit on the total risk. Getting 10% return on a normal basis is fine for me, but sometimes if it expires in the butterfly I’ve gotten 70-80% of total capital return. 

Weaknesses: it is positive delta so it is sensitive to price movement. IV spike can impact the position so I keep the loss at 500 on a 5,000 dollar position to try and avoid getting stopped out too early. It’s not going to win any awards for the greatest returns. 

Overall: It is a good tool for the playbook if you’re taking directional bias but are unsure about something. The 100$ stock may not have enough movement to warrant a position like this, but TSLA, AMZN etc would be good candidates for 30-50 point wings depending on your risk tolerance.",positive

"&gt;it's insane to pretend that every single growth company is the next Tesla or Amazon.

Palantir isn't ""every single growth company"".  I've done my Due Diligence on Palantir's business, and I think there's a good possibility (though nothing is every guaranteed) that Palantir will become as important as Microsoft and Amazon in the next decade.

There's no integrated software platform that can unify data across many disparate, isolated platforms like Foundry can.  This will become critically important in the near future, as AI platforms rely on a foundation of data, and decision makers need to know what is going on in a complex, increasingly chaotic world.

Palantir is not weed stocks, or gambling, or the next fashion or exercise fad.  It's useful, effective software with wide application to any complex organization in the public or private sector.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Tesla is valued as if it will take 90% of the car market

I've been a TSLA shareholder since 2011.  This is an inaccurate understanding of why shareholders like me believe that TSLA is worth continuing to hold.  Tesla sits at the intersection of 3 major, interconnected industries:

1. Heavy manufacturing, not just of vehicles (both passenger vehicles and trucks), but of robots/autonomous machines generally.  The speed and scope at which Tesla has advanced the art of manufacturing is driving down their manufacturing costs much faster than most people realize.
2. Energy systems.  Tesla Megapacks are being deployed worldwide as grid balancing mechanisms.  They're becoming critical infrastructure in a world where climate change is starting to impact grid reliability.  Megapacks and their software enable a renewable energy economy, because they can store energy generated by intermittent solar and wind power, and release it when needed.  Megapack deployments are poised to increase by an order of magnitude thanks to a new Tesla factory in Lathrop, California.
3. Artificial Intelligence.  Tesla now controls its entire AI stack, from the silicon to the artificial neural net.  The Dojo project is working towards an unprecedentedly powerful AI training system with general applicability for vehicles, robots, energy systems, and almost anything else.

Tesla's future is not just as a vehicle maker.  It's a bridge between the software world and the physical world -- allowing AI to directly interact with the physical world through machines.

Imagine a world where Tesla machines, vehicles and robots, do more and more of the manual labor in modern economies.  Imagine a world where one's electricity supply is managed by Tesla storage solutions running Tesla AI.  Imagine a world where Tesla also provides AI training services to other device makers.  That's where I see this going.",positive

"[I don't analyse sectors so I have no idea. I look for individual stocks I can understand so I naturally avoid most sectors because I have little understanding of companies in spaces like pharma, banking, materials, etc.  I'm a software engineer so I generally invest in tech companies as I understand that sector better than most. I also look for high-growth companies and tend to stay away from stocks where you pay a premium for stability which in theory should result in higher average returns, but this also means most of my stock picks wouldn't be considered pure ""value"" plays and generally have high, or in some cases non-existent PEs. So I'm not sure how helpful my picks are if you're looking for sectors/stocks with value in the traditional sense...  That said, there are a lot of small US tech stocks I really like right now. I think UPST is looking very attractive at its current valuation and I've been buying looking for a pop. Stocks like PLAN, YEXT &amp; COUR are all small, high risk names, but I think they have been treated quite unfairly by the market this past year and worth putting a bit of money in.  Internationally I like OZON and BABA. These are generally seen as toxic stocks to investors here, but both have strong growth and wide moats in their respective countries so long as you can get past the political concerns. I own these partly for international exposure so wouldn't necessary recommend either to the average investor.  The other half of my portfolio is much more generic though. I own names like DIS, AMZN, GOOG, SHOP, TSM. Some of which I think are a little pricey, but they have safety in their size and don't seem to be excessively valued. I also own a small amount of a few random stocks like BA and BRKB purely for diversification and couldn't really comment on valuation.  In general I'm much more concerned with avoiding bubbles and excessively high valuations. Until recently I owned names like NVDA and NET, but have cut these because of their valuations. I don't really care about 20-30% pullbacks, I just want to avoid the 90% drawdowns which would risk wiping out my portfolio. I think in general investors spend too much time seeking returns and not enough minimising the risk of catastrophic events. With the exception of BA and BKRB all the stocks I've named here could easily double or more over the next 2-3 years and I believe all are also very unlikely to see more than 50% declines even in the worst case scenarios. I could see an investment in Bitcoin, Tesla, GME doubling in 2022 too, but all could quite easily fall 90%+ in a worst case so are not worth the risk.](/r/stocks/comments/rqxfj8/the_biggest_difference_between_19982000_and/hqeklxj/)

[Well, you can actually do this strategy with really big money, on huge mega cap companies that you have unlimited faith in. For example, Microsoft and Google. Basically a scalping strategy. If MSFT or GOOG turns against you, you just turn into a long-term investor. Now the key is, you get way more daily and weekly wins before you end up stuck for several months on a bad entry.  Still, if you think about it, let's say you had a bad entry on MSFT, and you're down in the stock, and all your money is stuck, not doing any work for you. What about the long-term investor planning to hold MSFT for multiple years that bought on that same day, at that same price? They're no better off than you. They also have dead money. They just have a longer time horizon.   The strategy can be argued both ways. It's better to just buy a stock and hold it for years, or try to constantly scalp it, and if you get stuck, you get stuck. It'd be interesting to compare two investors. One, buying and holding for 13 months. The other guy doing nothing but scalping in the same ticker. Which one ends up making more money? I think in the case of something like AMZN, the guy scalping would have actually done considerably better.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rrhagq/albert_einstein_of_the_stock_markets/hqi85l4/)

[What worries me about technology stocks right now is that AAPL is basically at ATHs and I don't see how we can have a recovery on the NASDAQ if AAPL is trading at ATHs. Either AAPL's multiple will need to expand significantly as NASDAQ names recover or AAPL will need to sit out of any recovery. Neither of these seem to make much sense to me.  I'm also worried about how this sell-off has played out so far. Around the middle of last year low quality growth stocks started to sell off while higher quality growth stocks like SHOP, NVDA, NET, etc continued to perform well. Then towards the end of the year higher quality growth stocks started to sell off too, while large caps and lower PE stocks remained fairly unaffected. Then towards the middle of January even larger stocks, perhaps broadly those with less investor conviction started to sell off (FB, NFLX, PYPL, etc) but stocks like AAPL and MSFT which are seen as relatively safe remained fairly unaffected. Over the last couple of weeks we've seen GOOG and MSFT begin to fall again despite great earnings and it's starting to look like AAPL might also be slowly following.  Over the course of the last year investor sentiment has turned progressively more negative as investors have been fleeing lower quality to safety, but what happens when the safety trades come under pressure too?  I've brought this up a few times now, but in 2018 when the FED put balance sheet reduction on auto-pilot the reaction was very different. Everything sold off. I keep seeing people try to justify why great stocks like NFLX and FB should see such huge multiple contractions because of slight earnings misses and rate increases, and why AAPL should be fine trading at a 30 PE. This narrative makes no sense and if this if these trends continue stocks like AAPL are next to fall and if that happens it's going to be a blood bath for everything like it was in 2018. Everything is going to drop 20-30% and lower value, higher PE names will be hit even harder.  I was quite constructive a month ago, but I don't like the setup of this sell-off anymore. Given the risks we're facing the fact the broader market hasn't really sold off yet is odd.  Another thing to note is that the valuation of the overall market just isn't that attractive given where rates could head. Normally you would want to see markets overreact to the downside before buying, but this sell-off has been extremely orderly so far. If the 10y goes to 2.5%, which is totally possible, we need at least another 10% down on the S&amp;P500 and likely 15%+ on the NASDAQ. And again, really you would want to see a drop closer to 20% on the S&amp;P500 from these levels to be confident the market has overreacted enough.  The VIX is also below 30. When you have moves as extreme as those we've been seeing you really want the VIX to spike sharply over 30 to signal the pain is done. At this point I don't even think a 35 on the VIX would be enough. I'd want to see at least 40 which is still a long ways off.  I wouldn't suggest not buying here, but I would be careful about what you buy. I would look for stocks with some margin of safety for now, then look to rotate into riskier names either as the market continues to fall to more oversold levels or as risks ease. I mean, is there even a catalyst for a recovery at this point? If rates are increasing why would stocks recover to previous valuations? They could only rally if valuations are oversold and they're not.](/r/stocks/comments/svw5ju/are_you_guys_buying_now_whywhy_not/hxnigdi/)

[I will be the first to tell you I am not smarter than the market. One thing I have learned, the market will do what she does and it’s tough to predict. Technical analysis(and my own analysis is very basic) is just a tool in the ole toolbox. It’s Obviously not always right or wrong or this whole thing would be easy. To ignore all technical analysis would be irresponsible.   If the market shot up to ATH in the near future, I would be surprised as that is certainly not what my analysis shows as the market is currently trading under several moving averages and has several obvious levels of resistance to break thru to get to said ATH. I would be happy as I am long several stocks. I would still respect and use technical analysis to find my own price targets for entry points to long stocks and short term swing trades](/r/stocks/comments/svw5ju/are_you_guys_buying_now_whywhy_not/hxllr89/)

"I was in at $200 pre split since 2015.  my financial planner at the time talked me out of putting in $20k as I had requested (10% of my whole nut at the time) and talked me down to $10k.  

When it shot up to $800 pre, he had me sell half and take profits.  Pandemic hit so I didn't buy back in at $400.  

Then I watched it go up and up and up, the whole time kicking myself.  I would have 400+ shares if not for shit financial advice.  I fired him over that.  

I didn't even know what a short was back then.  I didn't know the significance of S&amp;P inclusion.  



Looking back, Tesla was the most obvious play in the past decade. I remember holding back on investing earlier because of all the car fires and such. It was suppressed from the get go, for YEARS.  But who the fuck would short TSLA in the first place?  what is the point? It was a popular growth company, like literally the worst thing to possibly short other than FAANGs. 


From that standpoint, you could hold GME for 5 years and just stop looking at all these dates, that's what it took for me with TSLA.  I didn't check the price once in 5 years as I wasn't really into it then.  Just read some stuff I liked about the company and wanted to invest in it.",positive

[yes, however the point is to make profit correct. the scalp in the 1 minute candle is probably not enough to warrant using a premium broker at least in my opinion.      so with that logic youd be -$200 before the trade even occurs     i'll use AAPL as an example on the 1 min chart. biggest spread was near open on 1 minute. with a .28 spread. ok. lets say you bought low and sold high of candle. great you made .28c per share traded....     At 50,000 shares low to high youd be making 14,000. WOAH baller.    youd need almost 8 million dollars... to have made that trade, so the risk v reward on scalping doesnt \*really\* make sense.   &amp;#x200B;  but feel free to make an example where it does make sense.](/r/Daytrading/comments/snr9rh/trading_platforms_geared_toward_fastpaced_scalping/hw4l0dl/)

[I know it sounds ridiculous but it's actually reasonable.  He's paying taxes on the growth of his passive investment when he liquidates it. It's money he's made, and even taxed at a very discounted rate in the US (The same tax bracket as someone who earns $40k a year).  And instead of getting a paycheck from TSLA, they pay him by giving him a discounted price in the purchase of X amount off shares. But this is still literally a paycheck for him, so it is taxed as ordinary income. BUT, again, this is still taxed at a discounted rate for him in the US because paying NSO tax still avoids social security, Medicare, and other payroll taxes that normal people working a W-2 job have to pay... even though it's literally his paycheck for being CEO. The cost of doing this? Needing capital to pay for the stock options.  It's complicated and certainly easy to misconstrue as tax on your tax because I heard you like taxes, but the complication only exists in order to help very wealthy executives get out of taxes that plebs like us have to pay on our W-2s.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rf1ajw/elon_musk_sells_another_9632_million_in_tesla/hocduf2/)

[Rivian is absolutely overpriced. However, Ford also has the problem of making almost no profit on EVs and also having a looming multi billion dollar problem of having to scrap all of their current ICE production to EV that they don't have a small fraction of the capital to do, and lose ability to gain every month as EVs begin to take over ICE market cap, as more and more people are willing to hold off on a new ICE and drive their used ICE to save up for an EV.  Ford thinks that 80 percent of consumers will want a new ICE car in 2025, and have that as their production plan... But I believe the narrative (and gas taxes and EV credits) are ramping vastly faster than that. I don't see 4/5 people wanting to buy a new ICE car (over used or EV) in 2025 when there will be talk of new ice cars being fazed out in 5-10 years. In order to catch up in any real way they would need to hault ice production in order to act immediately, lose alot of money for at least a couple years as they discard all of their ICE tech (costing them billions in lost production) in order to retrofit to EV (which would involve borrowing 10s of not 100s of billions of dollars) which would tank the stock for at least 2 years (assuming they could build and scale at Tesla's pace) and possibly (IMO likely without a second IPO round, dilluting the stock price) even bankrupt the company. I wouldn't bet on either Rivian or Ford in the long term. IMO If you are long and looking to buy the next Tesla stock...

"I was a TSLA shareholder before Dave, and I also bought PLTR before Dave did 😅.  From what I remember, his PLTR cost basis is 18-19, and mine is now about 21-22.  However, it's only around 1.5-2% of my total portfolio, and that's with me using all my spare cash flow over the past 1-2 months to bottom feed off shares in the 10-12 range. 

The markets have punished PLTR stock, but of all the speculative growth companies, weird SPACs, and ""overpriced garbage"", I think Palantir's products actually have world-changing potential.  

I see Palantir's business maturity today, as where Tesla's was in the mid-2010's.  Palantir has shown some success, but there's still enormous skepticism over whether they can expand their customer base and scale their software platform deployments.  If Palantir can prove its skeptics wrong, I think it'll be a 30-bagger investment by the 2030's.  Based on my due diligence of the company, I'm willing to wait years to see whether PLTR stock works out",positive

[There are issues with companies. What if these companies (you listed) going down another 40% from here?  1. Actual Value may differ from market value 2. Some upgrades or downgrades will affect the value 3. Big investor selling/buying affect the value 4. Market sentiment (Bearish/Bullish) affect the value 5. Many people are behind market price, buying when going up and selling while going down. Market matches long term (2 to 10+ years) to company real value, but short term (less than 2 years) it can be overvalued or undervalued.  All of the above can result portfolio going from 60% to 99% market drop, but value remains same (you need to identify right companies) !  I held many companies in the past, say SHOP, NVDA, MRNA, BNTX, TSLA would have been a multi-millionaire by now had I held them as buy/hold, but traded then when I got 100% profits!.  But, all these are not possible with market index ETFs and loss is low.  **In fact, it is very difficult to defeat the market unless you are extreme pro !

Growing up I would play in boxers and that was it. Of course, I also didn't air out my gear or wash it. As an adult I've always worn long sleeve top/bottom. For the last 5 or so years I've used TSLA branded gear I got on Amazon. For the price, it's been amazing! Back when I bought them, tops/bottoms combined were probably only $25. Insane price especially for the quality and how long they've lasted. I have a highly ventilated versions of tops/bottoms that I can't currently find on Amazon, but there are similar ones. For the price, these are a no brainer. They're not hockey specific and don't always help keep your elbow pads in place, but they breathe amazingly well and are inexpensive.  



https://www.amazon.com/TSLA-Sleeve-T-Shirt-Baselayer-Compression/dp/B081Q98XY8



Next up is Shock Doctor which is hockey specific. There are two different versions, but the primary one I'm focusing on has the sleeves that fold over your elbow pads. The shirt is made from traditional compression material that hugs your body nicely. There are silicone patches on the elbows to help keep your pads in place. They also have a sleeve that folds over the lower part of your elbows to further keep them in place. They're really nice and useful. Downside is they run a bit warm as the primary ventilation is under the arms, but that's about it. Wish they had a large back panel of mesh or something like that. If you play in a cold rink, this is a great option. Price-wise, these are $50-60 which I feel is a fair price to pay. 



https://www.hockeymonkey.com/shock-doctor-undergarment-core-hockey-shirt-sr.html




On the high end of the spectrum is Warroad which I just picked up. Haven't played in this yet since the league is on a holiday break, but here are my initial thoughts. The whole concept of their brand is to be tight in the arms and loose in the body. I'm not exactly a fan of this as I'd prefer to have a shirt that's tight all over. I sized down to help this, but then the sleeves are too tight so I stuck with my regular size and just need to deal with a looser fit in the torso. The entire body is made of a very light air mesh type material. Crazy breathable and I have no doubt these will feel great on the ice for people like me that run hot. The sleeves have silicone patches on the elbows and additional sleeves that fold over your elbow pads similar to the Shock Doctor I mentioned above. In addition, they have a cut resistant forearm protection which is a nice feature. Downside is the cost. Full retail is $140 and that's a tough pill to swallow. They have done sales up to 40% off which I feel brings them down to a more reasonable price. Even at a discounted price of $80, these are overpriced, but they are very nice. We'll see how well they hold up long term. 



https://warroad.com/collections/tilo/products/tilo-pro-padloc-cr-top-black





Last up is a basic top from Adidas that I'm still waiting to arrive. It doesn't have many frills other than silicone stripes on the elbows to help keep your pads in place. It's supposed to have mesh panels throughout and other adidas tops I've had made from these materials breathe well so I'm hopeful for this one. Can't comment anything beyond that, but the price is about $40 which puts it on the lower end of the spectrum. 


https://www.leagueoutfitters.com/products/adidas-mens-hockey-baselayer-longsleeve-shirt?variant=39593810034748





At the end of the day, it all comes down to what features you want out of your base layers and how much you're willing to pay.

Even Elon acknowledges that autonomy will not be Tesla's moat, but rather manufacturing. And tbh, I don't see anyone else scaling to 20 million EVs per year other than Tesla. And seeing SpaceX's manufacturing innovations adds to my conviction that Elon does next gen vehicle manufacturing better than others.

disclosure: I don't own Tesla, so just an observer.",positive
"Yes, the ideas are common place, an electric car.

Take into consideration other companies have also tried this. And all failed. And not always due to their own undoing. Other auto companies have been trying to crush electric cars for years. Its well know. And Tesla as a start up, faced lots of negative press and stock short pressure for years fight against all odds.

&amp;#x200B;

And Tesla survives hurdle after hurdle. They go beyond that and have the most advance self driving software arguable 3-5 years ahead of the competition.

It has the highest safety rate of any car

Its nearly the fastest car

Its the most ""American"" car when built in america. beating out Ford 150

They also saw the scaling problem with batteries and recognized they needed to be the makers of their own batteries to scale properly because they figured they needed more than the words supply of batteries (at the time)

and each of the tesla models and many innovations we haven't even talked about.

Then as musk says, making the car isn't the hardest part by far, its making what makes the car. and the Tesla Factories are a marvel of their own, and the speed they can get them up.

&amp;#x200B;

And this is just going through some innovations in TSLA and we can go on way longer.

&amp;#x200B;

You can do this with spaceX

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, he came from a wealthy family, but follow his story. He got into the software world early and saw internet as the future and did well.

Next he made paypal

then gambling all to his name including his house to fund tesla

his goal, to push humanity to a carbon free / green future with cars

Even opensources the patents

doing all the insane stuff that can happen for one person, he then starts spacex, and the challenges they go after are monumental, experimental, and very expensive. 

He puts his money all on the line, over and over again.

&amp;#x200B;

Take a look at Starlink

and neuralink

Then you look at the ideas like the boringcompany

&amp;#x200B;

and you eventually have to honestly take in the extraordinary amount of innovation ideas and creations that have been a results of him in one form or another.

"As I’m looking through Reddit it’s clear that people largely agree with the idea that Elon’s Twitter poll is his way of calling the top on TSLA.  I would be very surprised if we don’t see -10% or more on Monday.

I don’t have a position but will be interesting to watch.",positive
Last minute TSLA 1120c because I fucking love money,positive
"So, if $TSLA hits a 40x p/e ratio level, it'll be in the $300s. Elon will 100% have to put up significantly more shares to cover his $TWTR purchase. In effect, his $TSLA shares will be de facto owned by the bank. He's literally squandering his wealth. One of us! One of us!",positive

"30-45 days on big tech sell naked puts and never let buying power drop below 50k. 

Read ScottishTrader guide on this. 

Typically what works for me is 30-45 days naked puts about 0.10-0.25 delta and close at 50%

Tsla works great if you can do it in red days be careful and only open one put  at a time on tsla tho or it can blow up very fast. I opened some 850p at 1050 share price and same week it fell over 120 bucks or so. So if you opening more than 1 do it over a few days. I sold a 850p for like 2500 and it was worth 9k at one point so had I waited could have made a bigger gain.",positive

"I think TSLA is great and have a lot invested in there, but you are just ranting and spouting crazy talk.

FSD (e.g. Level 4) - will arrive when it arrives. Might be this year, might be in five years. Trying to time that is a bit pointless.

New gigafactories - while they will be great, especially once 4680 and chip production is sorted out, production this year from them will not be much. They are working on lots of new production technologies which will inevitably cause various interruptions and delays until they are all working smoothly and allow for mass production. Then as production technologies are validated there, they will eventually stop production in Fremont to update production lines. Meaning that we might not see significant production increases until 1rst or 2nd quarter of 2022 the earliest.

Blade Batteries/LFP - this is a huge unknown as to what that means  going forward and how it intersects with 4680 plans. A better understanding of what Telsa envisions as its future path and where these fit in, might be critical to understanding how profitable the energy side of things can be (including cost of batteries for vehicles).

Warren Redlich while he has some interesting stuff has said some crazy stuff such as suggesting in 5 or 10 years that Tesla should be valued as a multiple of sales. Valuation based on multiple of sales maybe makes sense for early stage companies, but rarely established ones where other metrics are probably better to go with. I would not take his word as to valuations very seriously.",positive

1. TSLA/Tesla is on the front page of r/stocks right now
2. Search would've led to you to many TSLA/Tesla threads recently
3. Use a mental litmus test - TSLA/Tesla is well known as one of the most popular and hyped(/meme) stocks amongst retail.  Do you believe it's ""not discussed here often""?

Come on, don't double down on this.

I currently have my cell phone plan through Comcast and pay $12 a month for it for 1GB of data and $10 for additional data.

I have cellular turned off for Spotify and streaming apps to prevent going over my 1GB and this balances it out pretty well.

Tesla operating income is fixed. As they build more factories - each additional car they sell will grow their margins even more. With FSD + new factories, I can see TSLA hitting 35%+ margins (iphones are like 40% margins) by 2024.

\#3.  The alternative to inflation is higher interest rates.  Fed govt spends more on debt interest ($300 billion) than on any other category.  Military killing machine only gets $200billion a year. Transportation only gets $150billion a year.  Even a tiny move in interest rates blows up the federal budget.  They can't do it.

Bought for $8.85. Then averaged down with [contracts at $8.50](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/ui3xy1/comment/i7ao8h3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). Between these two purchases, the contracts reached $13. I didn't take that one, which of course, in retrospect, I should've.  
I did have a trailing stop to start the trailing if she were to break $12, but that didn't happen.

I was [waiting for her](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/ui3xy1/comment/i7b0qls/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) to break support at around $2,390. She bounced off it three times.  
But then, she started to go the opposite way. I had an alert at $2,420, but when it triggered, that's when she was soaring (12:20 - 12:30), so the bid for these took a big hit (around $6.50) and I decided to wait.

Volume started to fall. Awaiting the FED meeting, of course. And I decided to gamble.  
I bought a bit more with [contracts at $6.00](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/ui3xy1/comment/i7b6pxb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). Cost basis was $7.34, and I didn't buy more.

As I told u/emeraldream, I would [either take a -50% loss or ride them to Valhalla](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/ui3xy1/comment/i7bb88w/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).  
And with volume tightening up, the catalyst would no longer be AMZN herself, but the FED.

For those initial five minutes, these ones jumped out the window. But I felt it was meant to shake people out, so [I held through](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/ui3xy1/comment/i7bk9mi/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), even when my alert went off. This play resulted in a big loss, but at least I'm glad I held through that shake.

I did hope for a [bloodbath](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/ui3xy1/comment/i7bn9to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), and it kind of happened. I could've sold for around $8.00 when things reversed and made this a profitable play. But I held through that as well.  
However, when I found out the Fed's cap was set at $30B per month--which is a relatively small number--and that it would stay like that for three months, I kind of saw the writing on the wall. The bulls were going to wake up.

It was extremely dumb that I stayed there, like a deer in the headlights, waiting for confirmation that bulls would take over. So instead of getting out with profits, running for the hills breakeven, or just taking a smaller loss, I wasted time setting up a stop order.  
[Sold for $5.50](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/ui3xy1/comment/i7br2pe/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

NASDAQ:ANY / 8

[I have a finance day job, so of course I'm super interested in becoming a full time day trader as well, but my recommendation is to determine if you have a desire to be a shrink (or anything else that would be ""productive for society""). Reason I say this is day trading can be quite lonely since you no longer interact with anyone and you're not really accomplishing anything besides building wealth. No problem with that, this is exactly my goal, but sometimes people require more. If that's the case, you could scalp premarket or within the first 30ish minutes or so of the market opening, hit your daily target, then move on to the rest of your day being a shrink or whatever. Once you're fully successful day trading/scalping, it's possible you'll get bored anyway and could move into swing trading or algo trading. Point is, if you have ANY desire to be a shrink, go ahead and finish. You can always do both, two sources of income are better than one, and who knows what the future will bring anyway.](/r/Daytrading/comments/qogeav/need_serious_advice/hjoxk8g/)

You should play tickers that the market makers incorrectly priced the IV, such as FB for their shit earnings.  Doesnt matter if FB moons or tanks, the only way you lose is if FB traded sideways or made a small move. In this case your odds of winning are greater than 50 percent.  Had you strangled 60k in FB earnings (30K otm puts, &amp; 30K otm calls) it would've been a 38 bagger (3800% gain) on the put side and a 99% loss on the call side.  30k puts with a 3800% gain is $1.17 million. 30k calls with a 99% loss is $300.  Therefore it would be a $60k to $1.17m.  Do your research, find your next company that previously blew/beat earnings and strangle their earnings and put in a smaller amount.

"&gt;TSLA already has so much future success priced in and is facing increasing competition in electric cars.

True, there is a fair bit of Tesla's expected success priced in, and there is still some risks to consider. My opinion is it's only those possible risks that are keeping the price where it is. I do not see any volume competition in cars for at least the next 3-5 years, possibly longer.

If 4680 batteries can hit decent production speeds, and enough raw materials can be sourced, Tesla will have a much bigger supply of batteries than anyone else, at a far better price.

Going on from that, the new megapack factory has a project production rate nearly a factor of 10 higher than previous deployment numbers. That suggests they are expecting and planning for a similar growth in business and revenue. Their entry into electricity production, storage and distribution is almost certain to become as big an earner as vehicles. 

With Austin and Berlin they have, (or will have once they ramp up) doubled their production capacity. They have enough cash flow, or even enough actual cash, to build a couple more factories every year or so.

Their gross margins on cars are steadily increasing, and with the new model Y, are about to see a ***significant*** increase. Deals like this one with Hertz suggest that demand is not likely to be a problem for some time.

There are some other facets that have potential, but with more risk. I'm still not convinced they can successfully get to FSD, and even if they do, whether they can get it approved. OTOH, etting approval might become irrelevant, I mean, they currently have over 100,000 people willing to sign up as Beta testers, At what point can they reasonably enter those FSD purchases into the books? For that matter, surely they can already count the subscriptions? 

Tesla solar, and solar roof, they are seeing the beginnings of a growth curve there, it has potential, but they still to prove the solar roof, and succeed in ramping installs.

I know there are others to consider, but I'm not feeling very sharp at the moment. Bottom line, Tesla is experiencing exponential growth right now, and I don't see many reasons for that to change for at ***least*** 5 more years, more likely 10.",positive
"Dollar cost averaging, FXAIX QQQM, ITOT, AAPL, MSFT, and taking a risk on TSLA.  Tech is not gonna be cool for a sometime and as warren buffet says be fearful when others are greedy.

"like... you can watch it when it approaches trend lines small and large. It gets mysterious volume spikes at the perfect time on a variety of charts to put it just past technical danger. Happens constantly (only to TSLA).

When they feel the stock is overheated, they tweet.

When the foresee bad maker conditions they have a press release.

When the stock is about to get hammed... buys happen and *just* put it out of obvious and standard technical sell-weakness levels.

It’s brilliant. And you can play it a bit if you use 10+ trend lines on a chart",positive

(If ETFs were included, SPY would be after NVDA at 24B, and QQQ after AMZN at 16B)

For anyone who's interested, the record for highest dollar volume ever goes to TSLA on December 18, 2020 (the Friday before it was added to the S&amp;P) at about $151B. Next highest I believe would go to SPY on Feb 28 last year at about $112B.",positive

"I think you're oversimplifying it.

Using that logic why pay rent if I can hold TSLA for 3 months in a bull market instead.. People have necessities that can't be avoided, if they spend much beyond that to the point they can't afford what they need nothing can help them. If the market for things people *don't* need was suddenly competitive we might see better quality products on the shelf.

The Ethereum blockchain is extremely conjested right now. It's also reducing its inflation rate by 90% in a few months. The transaction fees users pay to reduce conjestion are mostly burned too so the value of them is redistributed across the whole network. The effect of this will be an around 1% annual *deflation* for ETH down from a ~3% inflation today. 

Ethereum runs apps on it, one type of app is called a rollup that bundles 1000s of transactions into 1 so the more conjested the network is the cheaper each individual fee becomes. Apps like Rollups might pay $500 for its blockspace and generate $5000 in income for its utility, and users may be generating $10000 with that - so while the chain is net deflationary from the $500 Ether burn the value created within it isn't necessarily.

The more Ether that's burned the more scarce it becomes which increases the incentives to run a node at home to secure the chain (so you can be paid out in ETH) further adding to the scarcity and security.

You're correct users will not *use* Ethereum for anything... They will use Rollup's. That way instead of spending scarce ETH for blockspace they'll use Bobcoin or Rollupcoin or USDcoin, and some tiny fee will be paid per transaction that's converted to ETH to pay for the Rollup's blockspace.

Since the costs of blockspace will increase due to the deflationary/scarce nature of the gas token what that prices out are bad ideas - rather, apps that generate less income than the blockspace costs - which don't need to add to the already massive conjestion problem. Also NFTs and other extraordinary uses of finate blockspace.

No regular person will spend $500 on blockspace to make a transaction that might net them $30. They'll use rollups. The same principal applies if your new dApp only generates $1000 in income, why spend half of it on fees, use a rollup. Some apps generate millions of dollars in income so that fee is negligible to them. 

By having deflationary blockspace it very strongly enforces innovation to scale. Right now all users are fine either being priced out of the chain or spending $25 each time they do use it. By making blockspace more scarce it forces users to compress their transactions, reducing congestion, and adding throughput never seen before. Each token can have their own economic principals, you can create a cpi inflation token if you want as long as you pay for its blockspace. Users will go from paying $10+$25 eth fee to paying a $10+0.025 coin fee, which will increase the amount of traffic greatly since all the costs to are obscured away - like an NFT is only worth so much today basically to make up for all the transaction fees spent, if they can be made for cents instead people will sell them for cents too.

If people held deflationary ETH and decided to sell it to a rollup later, but waited several years, they're speculating that blockspace will be in higher demand later than today. That still contributes to stability even if they're not staking or doing anything else with it. They could use it in a rollup earning 10%+ apr though or stake the eth for ~10% apy so it's a weird asset to just sit on. The effect of everyone holding or staking would be rollups running out of ETH to buy on the market increasing the price until an equibilirum was met where people are comfortable selling and an app is comfortable paying. Rollups offer such massive scaling capabilities (10000s of tx per second compared to 15 tps) that they'll always be cheaper than the main layer and so themself never worry about affording the fee. None of those things seem inherently problematic to me. 

Deflation is bad when you're forced to hold and trade in one currency but when a merchant is free to ask from one of thousands that are each different it's not bad at all. Ethereum can afford its security budget *without* inflation just through a very small portion of its unburned transaction fees. The only reason any fees are burned at all is to prevent all the wealth from concentrating to miners. In an inflationary Ethereum with no burn the few thousands of people securing the chain reap the benefit of every dollar people spend on it, whereas it's the complete opposite with deflation.

If some people want to *invest not spend* a deflationary monetary policy but transact with an inflationary policy everyone gets what they need. And if people decide to use less deflationary blockspace (because it'll cost them more than they're getting back) they didn't really need to use it at all.",positive

[I don't think that they are inflated (aside from NFLX, PYPL iirc) , more probably a combination of irrational traders and options amplifying what should be 5 to 10% swings. If what you say is true about Goldman's leverage, their wipeout's damage is limited to the firm primarily to itself thanks to Basel 3, so I think another 2008 type margin event should only cause a problem to the themselves.  I hope another event like that doesn't happen again, but if it does I would hope some people get (deservedly) locked up.  I more think this Meta selloff is emotional more than anything else. The company still has avenues of growth in Instagram, Whatsapp, thanks to their network effect, and their usage of big data analytics to make sure they collect that 50% margin on advertising.](/r/stocks/comments/sjucf4/amzn_surges_15_after_hours_after_blowout_earnings/hvj4diq/)

[I have no money in it, but I strongly suspect reports of FB's and NFLX's death are greatly exaggerated.  FB literally has billions of people on their family of products. The idea they're going to be irrelevant at any point in the near future is absurd when half the world is using their products. Whether they'll outperform the broader market is another question, but at their current valuation it wouldn't be a bad bet...  I think NFLX will be fine too. People love their content and although they're going to see slower growth they'll remain an awesome company imo. I think they've just been valued way too aggressively in recent years and had to come down to a more reasonable valuation. I also wouldn't be surprised if they expand into other forms of entertainment. Gaming, sports, even user-created video and music streaming could be an option imo. I think they have a lot of options for expansion if they were interested, it's just not something they've had to focus on with such healthy growth in their core business until now.](/r/stocks/comments/sjvhda/amzn_lives_but_the_faang_is_dead_fb_and_nflx_dont/hvhl1lq/)

[Hard to say because the largest components of the S&amp;P500 aren't that sensitive to labour costs and labour costs are not rising as quickly as inflation so presumably this won't be too much of an issue in most cases.  I do agree some companies saw a significant pull forward in demand and this is a risk. Most large-cap tech stocks like FB, GOOG, AMZN, MSFT, etc, probably won't be hit too bad though. It's not like businesses are going to stop paying for AWS or Azure and labour costs for these companies won't increase significantly -- in fact many of the cloud companies probably stand to benefit. AAPL is less certain though and I've been saying this for months.  To your point, perhaps I am underestimating the risk of earnings collapsing this year.

[I’m on my 3rd decade of green technology stocks.  99% of them are out of business.    When AAPL was 60 billion in market cap or so in the early mid 00’s, they started rising to a 1 trillion dollar valuation over 10 years. They never went over 30 P/E, 20 was high and usually signalled a massive pullback.  7-8 was low and a buy entry.  All this while they were growing faster than any company not named Tesla over 10 years.  So what company is growing fast enough be worth double, triple, or way more than what Apples highest PE was in its growth phase?    That’s how tech was for decades. You buy under 7, you sell at 20, you hold in between.    Just because Jerome Powell ran the money printer for 2 years doesn’t mean these P/E’s are the new normal.  The printer is now running in reverse and you’re seeing the effects.    No P/E is not the best if you’re not versed in their earnings numbers over a few years as well.

"[1. You will fail. 2. You will lose money. 3. You will feel stupid.  Of course, you will also succeed, make money, and feel way smarter than  you are...  1. I think learning on your own is a much better tack to take.  You gonna be doing this for decades so the best time to learn is now.  There are huge amounts of resources online to learn what's going on.  And you'll never know all of it unless you actually work in the industry...  I've been doing it for 20+ years and still learn new things all the time.   2. Most brokerages offer no fees on stock trades these days -- it's fine to do it through your bank, or pick a brokerage, or whatever.  If you're doing it yourself and not using an advisor, it doesn't matter all that much which you choose as long as there aren't fees.  I use Schwab which has actual brick and mortar locations, but I haven't actually been inside one in close to 10 years.  Opening an account is no more complicated than opening a bank account. 3. A brokerage account is like a bank account with extra options (to do things with your money like buy stock), so no real limitations and no tax benefits.  IRAs are retirement accounts with tax benefits, but also restrictions about how much you can put in, when you can take money out, etc.  They come in two flavors -- Roth and Traditional.  The differences are important but you'll probably want to read about them specifically.  401ks are like IRAs, but they're done through your employer, generally subtracted right from your paycheck.  They also come in those two flavors -- Roth and traditional.  Many employers will do things like matching -- for instance, my employer will match any money I put into my 401k up to 4%, so I make 4% more simply by electing to shove 4% of each paycheck into the 401k.  The caveat being that I don't see that money until retirement, of course... But hey, it's still free money.   4. Money you don't need.  Traditional advice is you should have a rainy day fund for unexpected car repairs, etc.  Usually 3-12 months depending on who you ask and how conservative they are.  Then after that, shove all excess money into things like your employer's 401k, your IRAs, your brokerage account.    Order and amount will differ depending on your situation.  Usually the order is something like:   1. Enough into 401k to get any company matching (free money!) 2. Max out Roth IRA for the tax benefits, plus the money you contribute is easily accessible in an emergency (earnings not) 3. Enough to max out 401k 4. Brokerage  But your situation may be different.  For instance, I swapped #3 and #4 quite a while as I was saving for a down payment for a house.  In terms of picking what to invest in:  1. I'd probably start with just shoving it into an index fund of some sort -- VOO tracks the S&amp;P 500, or VTI includes all American stocks.  There's huge overlap between those, as the S&amp;P 500 is 500 of the largest US companies, so VTI is like 87% of the money into VOO, and the remaining 13% into smaller US companies.    2. You can stop there, and you'll do better than a hell of a lot of investors.  3. If you want to try and beat that or change your risk profile, the next logical place would be narrower funds or funds with exposure to things you don't already have exposure to.  Like VT invests in ALL companies, including overseas.  or VFH is specifically financial sector stocks, or VGT is tech sector stocks, or BND is a bond fund, etc.  (I'm just using vanguard funds because they're generally good -- others are also good)  4. You can try to pick specific companies, like if you're a believer in Apple, you can just directly buy AAPL stock.  But you'll already have exposure to it in those other funds you're already invested in, so you can kind of think of it as just weighting your portfolio more heavily in one direction than another.](/r/stocks/comments/qbr05t/what_do_you_wish_you_knew_before_starting_your/hhdh3xj/)

If SPY goes down Now, and Facebook breaks that 200SMA support, which coincides with also its Algo resistance, it’s going to be a long long way down before finding any other support. As it lies at the $250 range.  It can easily happen. This market is weird.  Idk about a crash, but it doesn’t look good for Bulls. right now market (SPY)  is showing horizontal support at a shade under 429 (3 touches). If it breaks that support, yeah, 200SMA is the next level of support, and that’s a big fall down.  The 100SMA is also providing some level of support to SPY, and at the same time resistance, as the market is completely directionless.  I’m strictly daytrading in this environment, cash only nightly. SPY is in a weird range right now. It could tank, it could go up, but when it decides, it’s going to be a very Swift move.

[I agree C and INTC are cheap. But I’m not willing to invest heavily into either of those businesses YET. In my humble opinion, they’re both turnarounds. They both messed up badly under their previous CEO’s, and brought in new CEO’s to turn things around. And like Peter Lynch said, I’d like to see real evidence of them turning around before I really invest in them.  I look at C like the 4th best pizzeria in a town with 4 pizzerias. Even if they’re selling their business to me at a cheap price, I don’t think I want to buy the worst one in town. I would rather wait until they become maybe the 2nd best in town, even if it means I would have to pay more at the point.   I look at INTC like the big old store in town that keeps losing customers to the newer stores that opened up in town. Sure, it’s still bigger, making more money, and I can buy it cheap. But I don’t know if I wanna buy a store that keeps losing its customers. I would rather wait and if I see them gaining their lost customers back, I’ll buy that store, even if it means I have to pay more at that point.  I know many people would disagree with me and that’s fine. We all have different styles of investing. This is just what I’m personally more comfortable with.  Edit: Forgot to say, kudos to you, OP.

Both of these companies have been the sole players in the GPU market forever, now Intel is about to put its huge foot into it and while they they didn't plan to compete at the highest levels, they did reach 3070 Ti performance at their high end (Moore's Law Is Dead leaks). Nvidia expects to lose big market share to Intel's first attempt at a GPU in laptops and OEM desktops and they aren't even going to fight it, instead going to release crypto mining card (Moore's Law Is Dead leaks).  Other than the above, just look at insider buying and selling for all 3 of these companies.

I'm not saying every company is 2x over valued, but the ones that have explosively went up along with the S&amp;P500, like many technology companies such as MSFT and TSLA, and maybe even Amazon, are going to be ""pulled"" down along the S&amp;P500.

[I have some atypical advise.    I would suggest not DCAing into VTI right now, since the slight adds at the current price will likely not affect your cost basis much (since it sounds like you went in heavy and are only able to add a slight amount right now relative to that).  Instead, I would open a position in VOO (or VT) and maybe QQQ, and start DCAing in at these better prices.     This will accomplish two things:  1) Psychologically, you’ll be back in the green much sooner and will also see that cost basis and feel better.    2) Liquidity wise, you’ll be able to sell the VOO/VT/QQQ positions much sooner for either a profit or less of a loss, should you want access to the money.     Once the rebound starts, just switch your DCAing into VTI and let your profit margin grow on VOO/VT/QQQ, which will be satisfying.  If you ever wished to simplify your portfolio, then you could take profit off VOO/VT/QQQ and put it into VTI.    The psychological component shouldn’t be underestimated.  Following this plan also has practical benefits.  The advice to just crawl into a hole and pretend this isn’t happening is not useful.  BABA is a hard one.  Xi is not his predecessor.  I’d recommend making a logical decision on it, and then either selling now and taking the loss, or committing to average down aggressively there at the sub $90/share price.  I think it needs to be one or the other, based on your own analysis and time frame and perspective.    On NVDA, you could offset that risk by opening positions in MU and INTC at the more attractive current prices.    I don’t know anything about Redfin...looked at it and seems to have good sales but no profit yet (potentially reinvesting?) and a TINY market cap.    At such a small market cap, if this is something you believe in long term, I wouldn’t worry about your present coat basis much.  What is Redfin?  Look at related companies and their market cap to get an idea of where it might go once mature or whatever your thesis plays out.

I believe many people also initiated/confirmed the transfer from the receiving broker end (Fidelity, Schwab, TDA etc). Personally, I transferred from TD Ameritrade to Fidelity, and it was all done in one phone call. I was given a transaction number, and my TDA account was closed (so get statements and documents before initiating transfer because you might not be able to login if it’s a whole-account transfer). Most transfers will cost a fee (usually $75) which you should have cash in the account to cover.

"I’ve got this one saved in my archives!

I couldn’t agree with Musk more.  Believing in millions of FSD users 10 years from now is the only way to justify Tesla’s valuation today.  

I’m one of the few on here that thinks Tesla’s isn’t 10X or more over valued today.  Imo it’s more like 2X. 

It’s growing it’s deliveries by 50% and is building enough capacity to continue at this pace through 2023.  

750k this year, 1.2 million in 2022 and 1.8 million in 2023.  

But given how stupid today’s valuation is, the downside on a 10% delivery miss is huge compared to any upside on a 10% delivery beat.   

The latter has already been proven out,  the former will be tested at some point soon, likely some time over the next 4 qtrs. 

Musk’s $50B though?

A FSD subscription would be worth about $1.5B a year of recurring revenue for every 1 million subscribers at $100 per month.  

The TSLA Stans say $200 a month, that’s $3B.  

So you will need 15 million to 30 million people to sign up for this to get within spitting distance.  

Not to mention the number of factories that will need to be built.  At 500,000 a facility (with a three year ground to full production ramp of 3 years) 20 factories are needed to get to 10 million a year. 

V9 ain’t gonna do it for FSD &amp; Austin/Germany ain’t  gonna do it for deliveries. 

TLDR- Math is easy",positive

"# Article text

&gt;The U.K. has set one of the most ambitious carbon emission-reduction targets among major economies, making the country a case study in how climate goals call for big shifts in policy, the economy and technology.  
&gt;  
&gt;Britain is one of several heavy polluters including the U.S., China and the European Union to have unveiled emission plans in the run-up to the United Nations climate conference in Scotland this fall. Fires in North America and in Russia’s northeast, flooding in Europe and China and a severe drought in Brazil have injected additional urgency into diplomatic efforts to limit the rise in global temperatures.  
&gt;  
&gt;In a bid to establish the U.K.’s environmental bona fides ahead of the conference, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the country will reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 78% from 1990 levels by 2035. President Biden, meanwhile, aims to halve U.S. emissions by 2030 from 2005 levels. China is targeting a peak in emissions by 2030.  
&gt;  
&gt;How Britain fares, having already made deeper cuts than other G-20 economies, will offer the U.S. and other countries clues about the steps needed. Emissions in the U.K. fell by 40% from 1990 through 2019, largely because it pivoted away from coal and toward renewable sources of energy in the electricity industry.  
&gt;  
&gt;Further reductions would likely bring tough changes in areas including transportation, housing and industry, according to energy executives, bankers and investors. Companies are paying attention: Firms from major oil companies such as BP BP 0.87% PLC to auto makers such as Tesla Inc. TSLA -2.17% are vying to make money from the U.K.’s transition.  
&gt;  
&gt;The U.K. government is committed to meeting its targets and will publish a plan for reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 before the U.N. conference, a spokesman said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Here are the five things the U.K. is focused on: Electricity Generation  
&gt;  
&gt;Cleaning up power generation is key because climate plans in the U.K. and elsewhere depend on electrifying swaths of the economy, including transportation and some energy-intensive industrial processes. The U.K. has made quicker progress on this than most other major economies: Wind power alone provided about 25% of electricity in 2020.  
&gt;  
&gt;The next step, according to the Climate Change Committee—a panel of external advisers that guides and reports on the government’s efforts to get to net zero—is to generate electricity from entirely low-carbon sources by 2035. That will require billions of dollars to finance offshore-wind farms in particular.  
&gt;  
&gt;Fierce competition is under way to dominate the offshore-wind market, pitting early movers such as Denmark’s Ørsted AS ORSTED 0.63% , Norway’s Equinor AS EQNR 1.74% A and U.K. utility SSE SSEZY 1.09% PLC against newer entrants including BP. “Electricity’s definitely the place to be,” SSE Chief Executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said. Power Storage and Transmission  
&gt;  
&gt;Switching to a power system dominated by renewables at a time of rising power demand will test the reliability of electricity supplies and the stability of the grid.  
&gt;  
&gt;The wind doesn’t always blow, so storing electricity will be crucial, said Robert Gross, a professor of energy policy and technology at Imperial College London. Some of the technology needed to do this, such as pumping water uphill with electricity before releasing it to drive a turbine, has been in use for decades. Other technologies, such as batteries or green hydrogen, are still being developed or remain commercially unviable on an industrial scale.  
&gt;  
&gt;More offshore electrical connections need to be built each year than have been constructed in any year ever, said Nicola Shaw, U.K. president at National Grid PLC. Transportation  
&gt;  
&gt;Cars and other forms of surface transportation are now the biggest source of emissions in the U.K. The country must quickly convert its fleet to run on electricity, according to the government’s advisers.  
&gt;  
&gt;So far this year, fully electric cars have accounted for just 8.1% of the market. Vehicles made by Tesla, Nissan Motor Co. NSANY -0.09% and Jaguar Land Rover Automotive PLC are the most popular.  
&gt;  
&gt;The U.K. would also need to expand its network of public charging points by more than 10 times by 2030. Buildings  
&gt;  
&gt;Another source of emissions that the U.K. has largely failed to plug comes from buildings. Reducing these will depend on insulation and draft-proofing, and on moving from natural-gas boilers to alternative sources of heat.  
&gt;  
&gt;The need to re-equip millions of homes could be a moneymaker for utilities such as Centrica CPYYY 1.33% PLC, investors say. Mortgage lenders such as NatWest Group NWG 2.04% PLC are looking to see if they can offer financial incentives to make homes more efficient. Carbon Capture and Hydrogen  
&gt;  
&gt;Hitting the U.K.’s longer-run target of net-zero emissions by 2050 would involve cleaning up sectors such as manufacturing and construction. Doing so would partly rely on less-established technologies such as using hydrogen to fire furnaces and kilns, and on capturing and storing carbon. SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS  
&gt;  
&gt;Do you think the U.K. will reach its climate goals? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.  
&gt;  
&gt;One big company pinning its hopes on carbon capture is Drax Group DRXGY 39.14% PLC, which produces about 6% of the U.K.’s electricity. In June, Drax struck a deal to use Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Group’s carbon-capture solvent at its power plant in Yorkshire, which has been converted to run on wood pellets instead of coal.  
&gt;  
&gt;The U.K. doesn’t yet have all the policies in place to eliminate emissions from the power system, said Drax Chief Executive Will Gardiner. “But there’s still time to get the curve to the right place,” he said.",positive
"It‘s not a matter of understanding it.  TSLA is not worth a trillion, I think we can all agree on that.  I’d be happy to be convinced otherwise.",positive
Remember when TSLA was going back too $900? Wish I'd just bought that dip instead of selling my calls at a loss.,positive
"Dow Jones futures rose strongly early Tuesday, along with S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, signaling a market rebound after the major indexes tumbled last week to their worst levels since late 2020. Treasury yields and crude oil futures rose, while Bitcoin rebounded from a sharp weekend plunge.

Tesla (TSLA), Li Auto (LI), homebuilder Lennar (LEN), Diamondback Energy (FANG) and Kellogg (K) were among those making news before the open.

Electric-vehicle giant Tesla will cut 10% of its salaried jobs over the next three months, Chief Executive Elon Musk said Tuesday. Meanwhile, Chinese EV rival Li Auto is set to unveil a new hybrid sport-utility vehicle, the L9, on Tuesday. Xpeng (XPEV) signaled a strong recovery in June deliveries, as the recent end of China's Covid lockdowns and fresh EV subsidies is good news for Xpeng as well as Li Auto, Nio (NIO) and Tesla.

Tesla stock rose modestly before the open, after nearly undercutting its late May lows last week. Li Auto, Xpeng and Nio stock were heading for solid gains, continuing a strong rebound. China EV and battery giant BYD (BYDDF), which hit record vehicle sales in April and May despite's China Covid restrictions, is not yet trading. But BYD stock has a new handle buy point just below record highs in a deep base…",positive

I'm asking you to name one situation even remotely similar to this. Please say VW or TSLA and confirm my bias that you don't know what you're talking about.

But also, pick literally any of the ""god-tier"" DD and you'll find some very salient points that prove how SI% is well beyond 200%.

[It really depends what you are trying to achieve.  If you are looking for diversified exposure you can split between an VOO and QQQ.   VOO will generate market returns, QQQ is a bit riskier but its still comprised of high quality companies - it is essentially  the equivalent of buying MSFT Apple Google Amazon etc bc those 4 have pretty high weighting in the index.   I am also personally invested in active ETFs like SPRX. The idea with those is that on the downside they could perform similar to QQQ but perform better on the upside. but higher risk as they are more concentrated.   I used to be invested in passive etfs only, but with rising interest rates the market could generate some pretty mediocre returns in the next 5 years.   I would do specific stocks only if you are doing research on them - usually keep it ~&lt;5%  At the end it depends on your risk profile - I would def start with VOO and QQQ.](/r/stocks/comments/smia16/how_much_do_you_put_in_etfs_how_much_do_you_put/hw1kq7z/)

I'm looking hard into the fact on how many trucks has NKLA sold. VERY VERRRY HAAAARD. And still does not get any figure beside the fact that most investment reviewer said: NKLA has produced ZERO stuff, sold nothing and did not earn any single cent. 

Yeah, I know all about those intangible technology value and all that jazz. But as a value investor adherent, no earning -&gt; no revenue -&gt; negative profit -&gt; trash.

I mean, come on. You can make a lemonade stand and tell the world that you have the greatest new organic lemon-fizzy-ade or whatever but you didn't actually have any lemonade produced or sold, are you even having a lemonade stand?

[But isn't the No.1 duty of every company to provide shareholder value?  Shareholders value stock price appreciation. Amazon could split the stock 20 to 1, resulting in AMZN trading at $171.27 per share.   Personally, if I was holding a bunch of AMZN shares, I would absolutely love this. Even though it changes nothing about the stock fundamentally, we all know it would go on a bit of a run, just because of human psychology.  If this actually happened, and this Monday it started trading at $171.27, I'd go out on a limb and say that it would likely be trading in the $206 range within a few weeks. Obviously, this would be assuming that there isn't any big news or the overall market is tanking or something along those lines.  That would equate to a 20 percent pop in about one month, and I'm sure the shareholders, who are interested in shareholder value would appreciate it.](/r/stocks/comments/pv2t8r/will_amazon_and_google_ever_split_their_stock_why/he8fo9m/)

[FWIW, I wanted to DCA into some of the extended family (MSFT, NVDA ...) of FAANG stocks, but I'm a conservative investor, so I compared their balance sheets, growth prospects and quality of their earnings.  I'm also prejudice, so I had to exclude FB right off the bat, as I subscribe to democracy.    I also assigned a discount to the stocks with Chinese entanglements.  As I kept drilling down and eliminating prospects, i.e., too rich of a valuation, too much debt, too cyclical, ... I kept circling back to GOOG.  And, that's what I'm DCAing into currently.

[&gt;Does buying 100% of a company’s shares outstanding automatically give you controlling rights?  Yes. In your example you don't own 100% of the shares.

The dilution will hurt all shareholders. They just don't want to be controlled by Elon Musk (look up the work environment of Tesla, and you'll understand why). Btw Elon Musk is not a free speech absolutist (look at the times he tried to censor others often with lawsuits).   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;C) TWTR board seems confident in themselves for this upcoming quarter  No they seem confident that twitter is worth more than the 54.20$ a share that Musk offers.

And that in the coming years the stock will be worth more.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;D) TWTR board is not rattled by EM and not looking to back down  Yeah, they won't back down.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;If that call is anything like the one from last quarter, I think it spells the end for Parag.

I just wish I had bought more when Tsla was around 1029 (where I bought 33 shares)

I had more cash but was fearful that the Elon sales of stocks would drive it down even further.

But that clearly didn't happen

So if I get one more chance with a nice 5 to 10% dip, I would go all in with 40 more shares to bring my total to 200 shares.  Nice round number.

In the last 5 years, focussed on purchasing growth stocks and started to concentrated on my positions.  Ended up focusing on Square, Tesla and still in Palantir as my concentrated strategy.  Lately, I started buying ETF's and Income funds to collect monthly dividends.

My plan is to hold my three growth stocks until 2030 and continue to reinvest my dividends every month buying more ETF/Income funds compounding growth.

Love to hear your input. Can I retire today?  Technically I have $1.179M  (between all my accounts) in TSLA share right now and it seems to be growing on average 20% per year.   Will this be enough?

"LCID is people looking for TSLA 2.0.

I think most here understand that TSLA does a lot beyond their EV production and the market is pricing in a very optimistic future versus their other ventures (as well as increased auto sales).

LCID is a luxury EV supplier. They have some positives in their tech but overall they're just an EV company. They're somewhere in the ballpark of 10k preorders.

Now compare them to a company like Ford who has a similar market cap at the moment. Ford does about 4m in New vehicle sales per year. 

Think about that. The market is very irrational right now but nothing justifies LCID's current valuation besides ""Bro EV is the future, get the next TSLA before you miss out.""

So BX themselves are ""capital light"" if you will since they ""only"" manage the funds  For KKR they actually invest their own money that they've earned from fees etc in previous years into their own new funds along side clients so their balance sheet will then be heavier since they actually are part owners of the funds  Very good thread btw  edit: as someone pointed out the PE firm/fund manager is usually required to invest 1-2% in the fund they run.

The EPS growth is lower than the 54% average annual increase in the share price. Shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 79% over 1 year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over 5 years which is 54%. Now I’m sure you’re wondering what all these whoopty doopty numbers mean. It means one thing - sentiment around the company has been positive. It serves them to create scarcity and drive prices up then swoop in as saviors. The increase in stock price they’ve achieved by maintaining a discrepancy in supply and demand is better than any markup or increase in production (diminishing marginal utility).

[They may be ahead in the race, but it doesn't matter that much when there's still such a long way to go.  The only thing that matters is how big of a breakthrough can the company get to push it past that goal.  A company that has a 100B cap is 9.9T to go, and Apple has 7T to go.  That's a 30% headstart on the race while being 70 times bigger as an entity.  So yeah, I think it's going to be what the next gen's tech is.  I doubt Apple has enough in it to continue making leaps in stock price from technological breakthroughs.  I personally vote for NVDA if AI eventually comes to fruition, TSLA if all shortage and tech problems get solved, FB if the metaverse really takes off for some amazing reason., or some next-gen tech that is not yet founded.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sn6eo4/what_do_you_think_will_be_the_first_10_trillion/hw22miz/)

If this ratio is about the same in most countries and as tesla scales their production, about a factor of five will purchase chairs. Next year, with about 1,5 million new tesla on the road there will be about 10 million new people wanting to invest in the company. 

At some stage there will be no shares left to buy.

The good news is they are kinda like TSLA in that their growth won't be based on demand but production. What I potentially worry about is that while they have cash, scaling up is expensive and they could end up having to issue stock or take on debt at a certain point. Also other manufacturers are able to scale production much quicker than we seem to be which means potentially losing out on market share if we can't meet demand.

The correlation between VTI and VOO is almost perfect. And the stocks held in VOO cover about 80% of the stocks held in VTI. So, if your only consideration is performance, both are pretty equivalent.

One thing to note - the indexes are opinionated. S&amp;P specifies criteria for which stocks can enter the S&amp;P 500. It's not just a matter of being a large stock!

So for instance, Tesla wasn't a part of the S&amp;P 500 until Dec 2020. So someone holding VOO technically didn't have any TSLA exposure until Dec 2020; while someone holding VTI would've been exposed to TSLA starting in 2013.",positive

"If you're bullish, only 2 things I'd advise you to look at:

1. Oil for short term upside trades; I don't think we're near the top there and this selloff is all based on economic worries.  Feels a bit early for oil to hit a final cycle peak.  Past few days of selling is just panic.
2. Small caps for longer term trades.  Small cap aggregates are the cheapest they've been in decades.  S&amp;P 600 P/E is nearly as low as it was in 2002.  IWM ratios look similar.  Obviously it's likely their earnings estimates need to come down, but the pain is already priced into small caps which didn't get a big bubble in 2021 like mega/large caps.

Small caps are overcorrecting here now while the large caps like AAPL, MSFT, and especially TSLA are just moving back down to fairer value.

Small caps are approaching historically cheap metrics here if the best price comparison is bottom of the tech bust (after which small caps dramatically outperformed large caps for 4-6 years).",positive

**H21 Leeds City Gate 382 page Hydrogen Study**

&gt;&gt;In July 2016, the H21 Leeds City Gate report was launched in Westminster. Using England’s fourth largest city as a blueprint, this pioneering feasibility study, led by Northern Gas Networks, confirmed that conversion of the UK gas network to 100% hydrogen was both technically possible and could be delivered at a realistic cost.

&gt;&gt;It provided evidence that the UK gas networks are the correct capacity to be converted to 100% hydrogen, low carbon hydrogen could be credibly sourced at scale, conversion of UK cities could be achieved incrementally, appliances could be converted to operate on 100% hydrogen, and hydrogen could be stored to manage intraday and inter-seasonal swings in demand.

Now the story: The first burn I've ever felt was with crypto back in 2017 (I was 27 at the time). There was this weird guy I worked with same-ish age as me. He believed in all this crazy shit like healing red light, crystals, grounding your body to the earth magnetic core via being barefoot outside 30 mins a day, only drank mineral water and glacial ice melt water, and ate minimum two sticks of butter a day to keep in ketosis. He also was a big crypto guy ranting about how the US govt will collapse and BTC will be the new currency. Since I had some exposure to BTC back in 2012 I decided to throw a few bucks at ETH, then ETH went up, then I threw more money, ETH went up some more, in no time I FOMO'd $2K of USD into ETH over Coinbase when everything was still the wild west. I heard about GNT (Golem network token) and moved all my ETH into GNT. My $2K shot up to $10K. I was over the moon! Then around late June 2017 GNT started crashing. I panicked and moved my GNT out of my ledger as fast I could, converted my GNT back to ETH and into USD. Got my $2K back plus enough to buy a new laptop which was sorely needed (as of today my dad still uses it). 

I learned some valuable lessons from this:
1: Don't get emotional about your investments.
2: Comes from one, if you can't sleep at night then you're over exposed.
3: Don't get caught up in all the excitement and/or doom and gloom. If you've done your homework stay the course with your investment.
4: Have a SMART goal and an exit strategy (dumb example I want to make Y% return by X date).
5: It's good to listen to opinions, but don't take advice from someone with no investment experience or financial/economic credential.

All that being said, that crazy guy is my age (32 now), he said he retired when he quit his job back in 2018. I wouldn't be surprised if he was still retired today just coasting on his BTC. 

I took all of these learnings and decided it was time, full bore into TSLA in December 2018 and made a killing in my Roth IRA. I sold all my TSLA shares in March 2021 and moved them into PLTR. I'm glad I learned these lessons early on. I still sleep like a rock each night. Although I joke to my girlfriend that, that laptop is technically a $125k laptop today 😂",positive
"106-7% TSLA (Margin for more TSLA) No home ownership or property. Why? Because I didn’t buy a house in 2017, I put my down payment into TSLA. I told my wife I knew I could better with this money invested.  Currently NW 5mill+. 
Kept our rental lifestyle humble with the wife for a long time and was very content, but in preparation for the new baby we upgraded our lifestyle to renting a 2 million dollar home a few months ago. Oh and I’m now a Dad as of last night. 🥰

Added Edit: Because I am not diversified I do expect big drops from time to time.  I have endured 3 40% or more drops in my NW so far. However my basic investment thesis is the future of transport is going to be electric, and I want to be invested with the”iPhone“ of EVs for that future.",positive

"Can't post a new thread due to insufficient karma. Thus, will be adding this post here.

I have started investing about approximately 1 month ago, and have picked out these stocks and crypto as long term positions. I would be listing out the main reasons on why I have purchased these stocks and crypto, and would like to get some opinions on my current portfolio.

50% Stocks

Apple (AAPL) 8%: Apple products are widely used, many loyalists to its product. Still has room for growth and do not see it dying anytime soon. Picked as tech blue chip.

AMD 14%: Bullish on semiconductors in the long term, picked both AMD and NVDA as forerunners in the industry. Picked for growth potential.

Microsoft (MSFT) 3%: Similar to AAPL, both companies are huge and have a large customer base, with further room for growth. Picked as second tech blue chip.

Nvidia (NVDA) 5%: Similar to AMD, hard to pick between both companies, and thus have chosen both. Picked for growth potential.

SEA LTD (SE) 11%: SEA LTD has 3 subsidiaries, Shopee (e-Commerce), GArena (Gaming) and SEA Money (Digital Payment). A long term pick in which I believe has a chance of being a multi-bagger and that its growth potential has not peaked yet.

Tesla (TSLA) 9%: Futuristic EV company, a favorite pick of certain investors. Similar reasoning to SE, with a certain amount of risk tied to it.

20% Cryptocurrency

Ethereum (ETH) 16% 

Chainlink (LINK) 4%

Purchased mainly to gain some exposure to cryptocurrency. Currently viewed as a commodity, in which I believe ETH and LINK has high growth potentials to it.

30% Cash: Currently untouched and waiting to be used to buy any potential dips or add positions in other sectors, as I am very exposed to tech-related movements. Will gain about 1% every month from salary, which can then be used to purchase more stocks.

Currently red on SE, AAPL and MSFT as most of my positions are new and would be looking to average down on these depending on market conditions. Also looking to diversify out of tech with stocks such as Disney (DIS) and Thermo Fisher (TMO). Not adding more funds into crypto, as I feel 20% is already a high ratio.

Opinions for improvement are welcome.",positive
So which of the sectors you mentioned demands 200+ PE? Any comparable that you can share? Fyi - margins are 10%. F is also same. Again tsla is a great company and is going to do really well. But saying 1500 as fair value??,positive
"[You won't see many established companies with share prices under $10 (even factoring in market cap)  Here are a few high risk, high reward companies that are close to around $10 that I've been keeping an eye on recently:  * AST SpaceMobile (ASTS)    * Opened at $12.27/share today * Rocket Lab (RKLB)    * Opened at $10.20/share today * Microvast (MVST)    * Opened at $9.09/share today  Keep in mind that these companies still have a lot to prove. They are different than the blue-chip stocks you've been into  A more famous recent example of a stock under $10 was AMD in 2017. Back then, I was staring at the price when it was $9/share. 4 years later and it's now at $110/share. These diamonds exist....you just gotta look for them.

[Thanks for this post, the question I have is how much money does one invest in such companies to get some decent profit if it goes big in few years ?   For ex: Even if i had invested in NVDA or AMD before 2017 1000$-5000$ each, i would have made some decent money. But if I had invested more than $10k each then story would have been different. So whats the risk v/s reward limit one should choose to pick stocks which are under 10$?](/r/stocks/comments/pgkcnb/any_stocks_under_10_a_share_that_you_like/hbgiffj/)

The one I glanced at on IPO and really wish grabbed was Roku. I was tempted, but someone convinced me it was a basic TV company, being relatively new, I listened, and yeah that's what happened.

[""I've been waiting 4 years for this ""shock"" to come.""  People were talking about a housing bubble in the US economy in 2004 and 2005, but the shock didn't arrive for another three years.  Same in 2001.  The major indices are being held up by GOOG, MSFT, AAPL, TSLA, AMZN, FB.  Between pandemic-related deceleration in demand for digital services and delivery services and companies pulling out of Russia, there will likely be significant earnings misses, significantly lower growth forecasts or both.    Add to that unionization movements, the growing clamor for regulation of tech companies, and all sorts of Biden Admin initiatives to undermine tech and I think the prospects of strong growth for major tech companies looks pretty dim.  Since market prices are predicated on strong growth, that means a decline in market prices.   Beyond that, if you look at the exponential chart of all the major indices, you'll see they are still far above long-term trends.  Unless you can think of some fundamental reason that stock market growth should be outpacing world GDP growth by historic margins, there's really no question that some kind of reckoning of this disparity ultimately will occur.](/r/StockMarket/comments/tz8m4t/major_us_bank_warns_recession_shock_coming/i46kn9a/)

[1) avoid content you have to pay for (other than books) any online content, especially the “get rich quick” types, are ALL scams  2) there are staple books/authors. Some listed above. Haven’t read them, but they should have good info.   3) there is a YouTube channel I follow. It’s free, and the owner intends to teach, for free, how to select investments, and how to organize your portfolio. He has tons of content, and has been very successful.he is live everyday during market hours, and if you listen to the messages, he won’t steer you wrong.  YouTube.com/thestockmarket you can also just search “the trading fraternity”    Summary: BUY GOOD, ESTABLISHED, BLUE CHIP COMPANIES, that you think will be around  for the next 10-20 years. Companies that if the stock were to fall, you would buy more, not panic sell.  Get some with dividends, and turn on the DRIP (but don’t fall for a dividend trap, generally &gt;8% is a  🚩 ) not a recommendation, but buy some AAPL, GOOGL, MMP, MO, ABBV, JPM, GS. For the big hitter blue chips. Then make the other 10-50% (depending on risk tolerance) of the folio some growth if you’re young. Think SNAP, RBLX, PLTR  You should be able to spot the dominate companies without doing much DD. Look around you. What do you see? Does everyone you know have 4+ apple devices? Does every company you’ve ever been inside use MS office products on windows machines?  Does every company is American manufacturing use ROK controllers (PLCs)? Does HON make a little bit of everything? What about CAT doing road work? Or WMT for groceries? does All good adhesive products come from MMM? The list goes on.   If you can answer yes to these questions, it’s probably a safe place to start: might they be around in 10 years, and have gotten stronger ? Would I buy more if the stock goes on sale? Do I believe in the company?   Hope this helps.   PSA: Don’t fall for the penny stocks as I did in the beginning.](/r/stocks/comments/u0e1ad/where_can_i_find_material_about_investing_in/i46u8y9/)

This is the exact same verbiage in GME's 8K filing, correct?  

So if what you're saying is true, why weren't all TSLA shorts forced to close in 2020?:

[The model of fabless design + dedicated fab companies beats the combined Intel model.  If Intel changes their business model, they lose their (only) advantage and are competing from behind. The later they wait, the worse it becomes.  Nvidia on the other hand is transitioning from a combination of semiconductor and software. They're going to be increasing margins.  Intel if they change their business model, their margins will drop.  If they keep their business model they will keep losing because they're competing against pure play companies.   Did you know that just 3 years ago AMD was less than $10 and Intel was $49? Now Intel is $49 and AMD is $155.  NVDA was in the $200s pre-split, they would be $1300 now  Also in 3 years, Intel's profit has declined, and free cash flow will decline further as they invest in CAPEX to catch up.

[&gt;Yes, I’m down more or less 70%. (Life savings, for this I’m a little worried) I bought BB at 20$ and PLTR at 29$, LMND at 140$ and DIDI at 9,50$. I haven’t sold, I’m holding but I don’t know if it’s a good choice or not. Isn’t better to sell and cut the losses? Or if I wait one days I’ll recover this losses  so is it better to just hold and wait a new tech rally?  Friend, investing all your life savings into high-risk small cap tech stocks and Chinese stocks is not a good idea. My only four speculative stocks - Cloudflare, Coinbase, Purple Innovation, and Sofi - are 20% of my portfolio, for example, and even that's enough to make me queasy when the market goes down.  I can't really give you solid advice, since I wouldn't have bought any of those other 3 except for Blackberry (and me buying Blackberry at $24 was due to FOMO). If I were in your shoes - and again, I don't how much you invested, how much you need money, how long you plan to invest, etc. But if you don't need money anytime soon, I'd hold Palantir for now. It hit $18 in the May sell-off as well and quickly rebounded to $28 within a month. So I don't see why Palantir wouldn't rise again during the next tech rally. Just know when you're willing to dump it.  BB is likely not going to $20 again, but seems to largely ebb-and-flow in a band between $8 and $12 (look at the one-year chart). So you've already lost most of what you were going to lose. I don't think this one will move much anytime soon, though it may retrace $6 if the tech slump worsens. So it's a question of whether you want to realize losses and redeploy, or want to wait and see if it bounces to $12. You could also just split the baby and sell half.  I don't touch Chinese stocks and never have. So if I had Didi stock, I'd sell it. But I admittedly know nothing about the company.  As I mentioned above, you've lost so much on Lemonade, you may as well hold for the next tech rally. With interest rates rising, however, small cap tech spec stocks like this will probably continue to get pummeled, so I wouldn't want to hold it for too long.  If you're unsure of where things will be, you can also just sell in weekly installments (20% each Friday), sell a certain amount (10%) on every up day, or something else.](/r/stocks/comments/r8y5yz/pandemic_stocks_valuation_after_the_recent_selloff/hnb48k2/)

The sell cycle for an on orbit asset from my understanding is about 2 years so I would expect to see this area of the business start to contribute meaningful earnings in 2024.

As to recovery I am not sure this is a legitimate question or a snark, but.  Spacex has proven that recovery can be cost effective.  This was not in the original Rklb plan, but after they recovered a few the possibilities were seen and they have decided to try it. I understand the cost of the rocket to be in the 750k range, and a recovery to be in the 50k range, so even if you only catch 1 in 5 you are way ahead.  As to the launch cadence, the forms that are required to produce carbon fiber forms are fairly expensive and the personal required to do the placement is expensive, also testing of the production article is time consuming. Again more tested recovered boosters allows them to launch more without additional capx envestment for increased production. Will it work? I think they have a a good chance.

Coincidentally enough, ANY EV maker will be eating GM's lunch seeing as how they depend on ICE sales, so I think you have your argument backwards.

Valuation is a bad metric imo. But if we want to use the TTM P/E then we'd have to find a truly disruptive technology to compare to... let's say AMZN in 2013.

"[The point here is that HYMC has poor fundamentals (elevated debt and cash burn, slowing or negative sales, profitability, ROA, and ROI) and it’s stock price chart accurately reflects this reality, but if you look at virtually any relevant valuation metric (P/B, P/S, EV/Sales) the company is extremely cheap. So HYMC is distressed but also in deep-value territory with the potential to turn things around and become profitable given its massive mineral reserves which have an estimated 34 year old mine life. In my view, the most crucial catalyst for HYMC’s turnaround is a surge in gold/silver prices since this would significantly improve the company’s ability to extract their minerals at a profit and rapidly scale operations. So the thesis has a lot to do with my expectations for a major gold/silver bull cycle beginning in the first half of 2022, making this somewhat of a macro play. If I’m right about the direction and magnitude of gold/silver price changes, miners should benefit and, in particular, junior minors (including HYMC) which are the most sensitive to commodity price shifts. That said, HYMC can literally go from being this beaten down, unprofitable company on the brink of (another) bankruptcy to a profitable company that will not only benefit from improving fundamentals but also from a major upward re-rating in its valuation metrics. That’s as clear as I can make the thesis, but to some people commenting on this post, that still won’t make any sense unfortunately and that just says something about them.   To your point about the big boys selling, two hedge funds that owned the stock recently closed down so there was a ton of forced selling. But I’d point you to Mudrick Capital Management, which is a $2+ billion hedge fund run by Jason Mudrick who’s had a stellar career in IB and investment management focusing particularly on distressed/deep-value opportunities. I’ve been tracking HYMC for months now as well as Mudrick’s exposure to the stock and I can tell you despite the stock’s awful performance, Mudrick has doubled down and increased their position by 54% this past quarter bringing their ownership of the company to 63% and making this the 5th largest position in their portfolio. I’m not saying I would rely solely on this to make an investment case but it is positive anecdotal evidence nonetheless.](/r/pennystocks/comments/rn7elm/hymc_a_deepvalue_microcap_43_million_goldsilver/hpvtdce/)

[I wouldn’t argue that there is good upside in $AG but what it boils down to is if you want to find the biggest possible multi-bagger during the next gold/silver bull cycle, you have to find a miner that has basically been left for dead but has the assets and potential to quickly scale in order to become profitable. I think that miner is HYMC. Therefore, while many people see a tremendous amount of risk given the company’s current situation, I see much better odds for this stock to reach my price target, and that’s how the real money is made.](/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/rn7of5/hymc_a_deepvalue_microcap_43_million_goldsilver/hpu30yu/)

[Here’s my thought process on gold/silver prices going into 2022:  Covid initially represented a risk-off event and gold/silver responded accordingly with higher prices, but then we saw monetary and fiscal policy step in rather swiftly to pump up both the economy and risk-on assets, which is where all the money flowed for the past two years resulting in the everything bubble we’re seeing today. That said, in spite of rising inflation and negative real yields, gold/silver prices still haven’t adjusted higher and that could be because markets are forward looking and expected (until recently) that inflation was transitory and that the Fed would soon raise rates due to a booming economy (which would weaken gold/silver prices). However, as that is not the case, inflation will continue to move higher forcing the Fed to tighten into a decelerating economy, which will lead to a recession or, perhaps, even a depression next year. If these events play out, which the probability seems very high in my view considering the government has no more room left to spend (otherwise they’ll go bust) and the Fed has simply lost all credibility in their effort to combat inflationary pressures, gold/silver should be major beneficiaries (along with the miners). Combining the current low sentiment for gold/silver/miners with the expected surge in demand for risk-off assets when shit finally hits the fan in the first half of 2022 and the government/Fed have no ammo left to prop up the economy leads me to believe that the upside potential looks extremely attractive for gold/silver and especially beaten down miners like HYMC.](/r/RobinHoodPennyStocks/comments/rn7of5/hymc_a_deepvalue_microcap_43_million_goldsilver/hpsxa2q/)

TSLA is valued more like tech and less like auto.  Comparing TSLA to AMZN for instance they are not far off.

"Search “best stocks for day traders” and you’ll find a few sources that have made a few lists of stocks that tend to move quite a bit regularly throughout the day. Which ones you pick to settle on depends on your capital and risk tolerance.

For me, I have eight on my “permanent” (in quotes because nothing is permanent) watch list that I scalp options from: AAPL, AMD, AMZN, BA, FB, MSFT, NVDA, and TSLA. Of these, I trade three very frequently (AAPL, MSFT, NVDA) and will dabble in the others with the right setup and comfort level.",positive
"Are you continuing to scalp these or are you maintaining a short position (no matter how small) going into end of July earnings? Technically, the charts look like TSLA is poised for another retest of $620, which is the support from almost a year ago. If that goes, the next support down is the $550 zone. I can't see how they post anything even remotely positive come the ER. I don't want to tie up margin in my cash account where I'm day-trading ES and bag-holding UAN, but like you, I'm limited with what I can do in my RRSP.

"*This is a monthly Raindrop chart of Tesla that focuses on getting the full picture for Tesla on both the technical and seasonality side of things into the rest of 2021. This chart focuses on using volume tools as well as historical seasonal statistics since the IPO to get an idea of how Tesla stock may move in the coming months. This chart was created using the TrendSpider platform.*  
  
1. This number represents where the anchored volume by price (VBP) and volume weighted average price (VWAP) start at, which is the “anchor” point. In this case, we are measuring both the volume distribution (VBP) and average price (VWAP) since the covid lows as this was a “reset” in the market when all participants capitulated from the Covid Panic. This volume weighted average price below (blue line) shows what the average price per share is since the Covid low which essentially shows the dollar cost average price of all shares transacted since that point in time. As you can see, with the price at $680 and the average price per share since March 2020 at around $400, the average participant has quite a bit of profit.  
  
2. This number shows the quarter-to-date anchored accumulation/distribution indicator on TrendSpider going red after over a year of being green during the uptrend that started in Fall of 2019. This indicator going red shows selling pressure starting for Tesla after topping out earlier in 2021.  
  
3. This number shows the recent monthly breakout through the resistance trendline since the 2021 highs. As you can see, there is quite a bit of volume at the top of the month of August’s range shown by the raindrop chart and the volume profile (bulge) at the top of the range. However, it is also important to note that into the end of August, this Raindrop is red which confirms the red monthly candle as well. Anytime you have a red raindrop and red candle, it shows confirmation of a move. On top of this, you can also see a volume shelf forming here which is the gray area pointing out to the right which shows a decent amount of volume building at this current price level and has been a base for price to move up off.  
  
4. This number shows the historical seasonality for Tesla since the IPO in 2010. As you can see, going into September and October, TSLA only has a 36% win rate which is one of the lowest performing months of the year historically. Include this with the red candle and red raindrop, it may be worth having a cautious approach into the coming months.",positive

tesla has no pr, no advertisement unless.. feel free to join the next tsla earning call and ask them to disclose their marketing spending though. if you think elon running his big ass mouth advertising, i guess.. but i have never personally seen tesla buying youtube ads to preach a system that is not yet available and impies that drivers can take their hands off the road (cough cough gm super cruise)

nah i think if the airplanes can call it autopilot while having two highly trained pilots on the seat, tesla autopilot name looks more than fair to me",positive
"&gt;  but then I could just say that the options influence on the stock is always neutral, since every options contract sold or bought has a MM doing the opposite thing.

That's my point: if I buy 1,000 put contracts with a delta of 50%, the MM will sell:

    1,000 × 100 × 50% = 50,000 TSLA shares

That dilutes the TSLA float by 50,000 TSLA shares.

If those puts expire worthless, the delta will slowly fade to 0%, and the MM buys back 50,000 TSLA shares. I'm poorer with the premium, TSLA float is tightened by 50,000 TSLA shares in an anti-dilutive process.

Now imagine the same with the currently open 1,000,000+ put contracts that expire tomorrow and next week ...

We are talking about a substantial delta dilution effect.",positive

[FUBO is a great idea but its in an already saturated market in TV streaming and is trying to penetrate and even more saturated market in gambling. they’re using sports as a selling point but they’re channel lineup isnt much different at a base level. as a sports fan i get everything i need with directv stream. selling sports as a reason to switch sounds great on paper but every league has they’re own service with Sunday Ticket, NBA League Pass, ESPN+, and MLB package. its a saturated market that has better alternatives. as for gambling, its clear that only a few companies will survive and I can put a guarantee that FUBO will not survive. yeah DKNG is spending absurd amounts of money like the US government but they have always been upfront with why they are spending by making acquisitions as well as customer acquisition. their goal is to spend, spend, spend and as they expand into more states, the states they’ve been in for a while like NJ, will turn profitable and start subsidizing recent states](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qy6t0w/can_you_believe_that_fubo_is_down_to_a_market_cap/hlf8jeq/)

"&gt; I needed some cash in Aug to pay for my solar roof by selling some covered call leaps. Jan 2023 $1025 strikes. 

Side note: Don't write covered calls so far out. Too much information will change so that you can't have any confidence in a decision you made a year or more in the past. Maximum of 60 DTE should be the limit. If nearer calls would not have generated enough cash to cover your solar expense, sell shares.

What was the cost basis of the shares? If 1025 represents an enormous gain over your cost basis, why are you even worrying about it? Who cares how much TSLA goes up over 1025? Clearly, you didn't, when you wrote the call.

Don't turn a huge win into a loss. That would be the dumbest thing you could do. Also, don't write calls on shares you want to keep for the indefinite long term. The way to think about writing calls is you are selling the future gains on the shares for a premium.

"[Well, I see what Burry might have considered from a market fundamentals perspective but not a trading perspective.   AAPL has a lot of its revenue depending on high volumes of iPhone &amp; computer sales. Most people don't need to buy a new iPhone or computer more than once every 3 years, and just upgrade if they like to have nice things. Because the market for business &amp; personal electronics was saturated in 2020 &amp; 2021 due to the pandemic, that means the choice to upgrade/buy new in 2022 &amp; 2023 will be mainly due to a trickle of new smartphone/computer users &amp; people with a lot of discretionary income who like to upgrade to new shiny models even though they don't really need to. With inflation in electronics &amp; the Fed tightening likely to cause recession there's not only a likely stiff drop in discretionary income but also maybe some hardship coming. Also, the pandemic is over enough that many people aren't sitting at home consuming media all day every day, so there are headwinds for all pandemic media winners. So I can see why he might not bet on a great 2022 for AAPL, even without the China lockdowns.  But that's purely from a marketplace perspective. From a trading perspective, there are a lot of people who pore over every metric of AAPL and will pile into the stock no matter what. It's a cult stock. I wouldn't count on going against Apple's retail trading fandom.   IMO the only reason it dropped was the tech sector dump. If everything was still going strong for growth stocks, I doubt AAPL would have dropped much.

At best he will be a cancer patient on powerful meds and very weak needing 12 hours of sleep a day. if he has blood cancer he is likely dead soon, and if he gets covid that could kill him.  Plus Finland-Sweden joining NATO shatters Putin's delusions of grandeur. A united Nordic front alone could defeat Russia in a war, even without the US and the rest of NATO, and now even Turkey, China and India are clamming up and refusing to back Putin.  So if that war ends and the good guys win, oil will drop $30 and the Fed might put the brakes on rate hikes.  Plus the China covid shutdown will end any day now.

[Intel.  They're worth about 200 billion right now.  \-Mobileye is worth about 50 billion I've read, due to the craziness that is self driving car hype.  They are selling off a little less than half to generate money for fab construction.  \-They are releasing a GPU in a month or two, which should make about 6 billion a year I suspect given AMD's revenues.  They also have bundling/monopoly power making them an easy drop-in replacement for Nvidia in enterprise laptops.  \-They are receiving many tens of billions in subsidies for their new fabs.  ASML will also help them get there successfully I think, as a matter of national security, given they are a European company.  There seems to be a growing demand for protectionism in technology, Huawei is the best example.  \-Intel is getting more into software and security as well.  Gelsinger ran VMWare, so has experience in selling software; I think they can easily target corporate markets given their size.  I bought AMD at 6$, and I'm now equally excited for Intel, which is where I moved all my AMD profits.  The headwinds Intel has now are massive, if you can stomach the wait for fabs to be done.  Its also great value, in a rising interest rate environment you want these high dividend stocks.  Nvidia could drop 75%, if Intel did the same they would be generating 40% revenues relative to marketcap.

Anyways, this wasn’t about TSLA. That was just an example of a firm that invests a lot in the growth of their business and that has, by most accounts, a business that is expected to grow very quickly.

[Lol missy you clearly know nothing about how the game is played. So have a seat, get that sand out of your vagina and let me educate you a little bit. Who gives a fuck about inventory when you’re playing the numbers. For all we know they may be suppressing inventory to maintain scarcity. First of all it is important to note NVDA has gone up 756% in the past 5 years. During this growth period they achieved and EPS of 42% pa. The EPS growth is lower than the 54% average annual increase in the share price. Shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 79% over 1 year. That gain is better than the annual TSR over 5 years which is 54%. Now I’m sure your simple brain is wondering what all these whoopty doopty numbers mean. It mean one thing - sentiment around the company has been positive. It serves them to create scarcity and drive prices up then swoop in as saviors. The increase in stock price they’ve achieved by maintaining a discrepancy in supply and demand is better than any markup or increase in production (diminishing marginal utility).

Considering all the crap a lot of Tesla owners have to deal with in the States on the service front with the presence of their mobile repair network, I can’t even imagine how frustrating things could be in Hokkaido where they don’t even have any mobile service.

Start with 1$ 💵 , or a single share , stock ....if your broker doesn't allow you to trade with minimum 1$ then look for someone that allows.....  that way you will know the taste of winning or losing money , you will realise how your win or loss affect your emotions ...   You can lose in 10 ,20 or 50 times in a row before finding your edge...  That's the sacrifice you'll need to make. Its better than funding your account with 100$ ,200$ or 500$ and losing it all.

"[But you've give no reasons apart from in 2000, it went in a particular order of corrections yet ignore all the differences. Companies at that time were valued hundreds millions for basically having a webpage and online presence yet no earnings. that was an age more akin to the S**t coins in crypto. Maybe also EVs. I tend to see more sector boom bust cycles now with stupid valuations rather than everything. Ie pharmaceutical boom then bust, weed stock boom and bust. EV in a boom atm and coming down.  We need a catalyst for a full market wide dot com level bust, I don't think a 1.5% rate hike would be enough.  Not when we are coming out of covid, even the trading updates are showing good profit and growth even with supply pressures (all expected to ease)... arrows look to point to the economy wanting to move Into recovery not economy wanting to collapse.  Inflation is caused by the excess printed cash outstripping the demand of products people want, this has been compounded by covid supply issues.  I'd expect them to ease into summer with more people working and getting back to normal.   What are the massive economic problems so persusive to cause  A huge crash? ... because you haven't listed any.  Tesla has an obscene valuation, a few others and a few meme stocks.  They arnt the market though, semis are priced well for growth. Apple, amazon, Microsoft have had a small retraction but sit at valuations quite modestly compared to previous years and pricing includes growth made into the new cloud services and now into ai.   The mega caps are now a mini index into themselves due to their sector exposure from company buys and branching, this was never a thing in 2000s or before.   I'd be happy to be pursuaded to any point showing apple, microsoft is going to a  below 15 p/e ratio with the latest trading updates. You need those pins to fall for the index to bust like 2000s.   It could happen slowly as you say but growth would need to slow down substantially...   but it looks like it's not.   Value stocks are coming out of covid, they should, SHOULD improve as more people go back to normal, work and buy as we used to.  Hopefully if China and USA tensions ease, supply issues will improve again, and once China moves on from its zero covid policy, improvements in supply yet again. If China has a severe covid infection rate and locks down substantially, I can see inflation worsening but that's speculation.  Give me facts please why this isnt happening or won't happen?

"It is nice to find some good classic math here.

Your work is excellent, and yes, your conclusions are correct. There is correlation and at the same time there is no correlation. I think that correlation exists in panic-times, whereas normal times, they are independent. 

I did a similar job, you can improve this. The NASDAQ index is weighted like this:  
AAPL  12.628     
MSFT  10.371  
AMZN 6.087  
TSLA    4.081

That's 33.167% there! Supposing that the remaining stocks will move up/down cancelling each other, you can safely assume that based on 4 stocks movement you can improve your entry points, NASDAQ will follow them.. This is a long story.

You can find more interesting fact plotting the same BTC/AAPL BTC/MSFT BTC/AMZN BTC/TSLA, and the most interesting data is the plot in the earnings release date of one of those big 4.

If I need clothes for work, I typically go to JC Penny. If I need extra fancy clothes for work I go to Joseph A Banks or Men's warehouse.

Surprisingly, Costco has some absolutely fantastic clothes of all types. You never know what will be at the warehouse that week, but it's always worth a quick whip through. I've bought shorts, pants, coats, button downs, t-shirts, and various clothing from there in the past.

Brand-wise, I've found that Apt 9 (carried at ~~JCP~~ Kohl's, and maybe others) makes some really high quality and comfortable t-shirts. At first I thought I was grossly overpaying, but now that they've held up through several wash cycles, I see they are well worth the money.

If you need non athletic shoes, Sketchers makes almost everything else you might need with reasonable quality and prices.

If you need quality fitness clothes, I swear by TSLA (on Amazon). I haven't had a bad product from them yet.

The money going into the account can’t exceed 3k per year, this is that max gift able allowance.

To keep it simple and reduce paperwork I would suggest US based ETFs, ones that don’t pay dividends (these would incur income tax). In most cases these will be growth focused ones like the ARK funds.
Selective stocks that have no dividends or a combination of both.

Stocks like SQ, TSLA, SNAP, RBLX probably won’t have a dividend for years to come. 

Socks like Facebook, currently has no dividends but its growth has to be coming to an end, it could start paying a dividend in the next 5 years. 

Stocks that don’t pay a dividend, tend to be young and in growth mode. Some will work while others might fail. Review the portfolio once a year, pick  like Peter Lynch, sell the ones that are not growing. Put the money into the ones that are working.

"&gt; Say that I do believe the price of Tesla will be over $455 in 2023, and I can put the collateral aside. 

this means you will get 14,465 for free

you're selling a june 16th 2023 put at the 600 strike. for this, you will receive 144.65 giving you a CB of 455.35 if assigned while putting up 60,000 as collateral. If TSLA is below 600 by 6/16/23, you will be assigned 100 shares (but keep your initial credit). If TSLA is above 600, you will receive your 60k back along with the 14465 premium giving you a return of 24% over 2 years. It will also mean if TSLA hits 2000, you will miss out on any potential gains.

Although unlikely, there is a chance you get assigned early but regardless, the collateral is on lockdown the entire time your put is sold to open. I think that pretty much covers everything.",positive
Is that why you have some $100k in TSLA and others have $6billion? Because they just bought and held with more money than you? Haha,positive
"I'm at your portfolio size (sort of, because I deposited 10k into my account and I'm pretending that's all the money I have) and I'm in F, CLF, and MARA right now.  I think MARA is at a shit entry point currently though so wouldn't recommend it today if you're getting started; if you can catch a dip below $32 then maybe consider it but I'm having a hard time seeing that.  F and CLF are both in a good place right now though, and CLF has decent premium.  F has kinda crappy premium but it trades sideways pretty reliably and I think it has really good long-term value especially based on the new F150 Lightning which is going to fucking crush TSLA in the truck market.  I'm actually not really liking TSLA nearly as much anymore after realizing the Elon Musk is mostly an idiot, having effectively re-invented the bus, the train, and the airplane and yet somehow managing to make ALL of those things worse overall the way he wants to do it.  I kinda like PLTR, MVIS, TLRY (yeah they're a bit of a meme stock but I like the industry and the company long-term anyway), AMD (do a PMCC with this one), and NVDA (also PMCC).  I like RKT, PINS, and DKNG a bit less but they're also not terrible either, just not really my preference (except maybe RKT).  How much experience do you actually have with trading options and the wheel?  If it's a decent amount, then I'd pick three stocks (or at MOST up to five, but three is better) and wheel those for a while and see what happens.  Also consider doing a portion of your portfolio to multiple different strategies, so maybe 10% LEAPS (not PMCC), then 45% spreads and 45% wheel or whatever makes sense for you.  Just be sure you have an exit strategy for your max risk per trade and that you actually fucking follow it, or you'll blow up your account by paying tuition to Options University.",positive

NYSE:TV / 18

[Depends on your style of trading, but I trade tick charts, and TV doesn't support those, but NT does support basically everything else TV does. So you may find TV unnecessary...  There's a lot of decent free add ons for NT in their user share forums too, just scroll through the lot and see if anything might work for you (there's only a few hundred scripts).  If you're trading futures you will probably want to explore volume profile and market profile stats. Although to be honest, I just mark up my chart with VPOC, VAH/L etc and trade around them, I don't trade what might be implied by profile structures themselves - worth educating yourself about nonetheless and Jim Dalton's books are where to for that. For profile indicators you either need the lifetime license with NT or a paid indicator (Rancho Dineros offerings are probably best in my view).  Opening range indicators are also quite useful. I use it for the opening minute, but they can be applied to the initial balance/first hour of trading too, others will trade this differently (opening 5 minute etc.). There's free ones on the NT forum.  If you're trading demo (and you should while you learn!) you can get a couple of weeks of data free from NT when you click download. You can extend that longer if you use a different email AND make sure you access their site via a VPN and have cleared your browser cache (otherwise they'll block access to the new demo data credentials) so you can keep playing with the demo for free as long as you like.](/r/Daytrading/comments/rvoxuz/soaking_up_futures_trading_what/hr6vuj6/)

"[My god the dick sucking in this post. how the hell do you not yolo in FDs on the daily?  Seriously though, let me just break down the issue here.  Zuckerberg captured lightning in a bottle. The REASON FB was successful was because there was no stable competition. also that pioneered bit is factually false. Myspace was the groundwork for social media. It was poised to succeed but failed because of poor business decisions and stagnation, even with a MASSIVE jump start compared to FB. You try to downplay this by lumping it with all the other alternatives, but the point is that myspace was making many of the same moves facebook was, but was bogged down with those poor decisions squandering what should have been reinvested profits. They were faux competition which is why they fell by the wayside.  The reason it's so important that the Winklevoss twins started it is that all Mark had to do was not fuck up. he didn't have to succeed or push for any innovation. Just hire the right people and don't let any morals bog down his money chasing. Now, yes, that's certainly some good qualities for the CEO of an amoral multi billion dollar information hoarding empire, but it is not enough for someone to build a new empire.  Zuckerberg will likely succeed again, but not as unequivocally as he did with facebook and even that future success is uncertain. Zuckerberg has never had real competition to deal with. By the time anyone came to challenge Facebook he was already established. Because the social media industry was lightning in a bottle, there's such an astronomical unlikelyhood he'll EVER be the one to jump on an industry like this again. These past few years have been the first time he's had to go toe to toe with real competition, and now we see how well that's turned out.  You're focusing so hard on his age, but that's an indication that his success DID NOT STEM FROM FUNDAMENTAL EXPERIENCE OR KNOWLEDGE. It stemmed from the situation and opportunity, and while it shows he can grab opportunity when presented, it does not indicate any empire-building skills outside of the bare minimum which a surprising number of people have, they just lack the opportunity and privilege Mark had.  And there is absolutely no way he is getting back into the social media game, his home turf, if FB stagnates out of the market. Social media is unimaginably fickle and success changes with the breeze as it inherently follows social trends and fads, which are temporary (another reason myspace found itself struggling as it had gone out of fashion, even with the same progressions). Betting on one CEO in social media would be like betting on a single number on a roulette table, there is nothing that number has that will make it any more likely than the other 35 to be hit.  Long story short, Zuckerberg's age is a hinderence to your argument, proving he was a lesser factor than the other mentioned billionaires. He captured lightning in a bottle and has no proven *personal* track record of success, and betting on him is more akin to betting on his money and those around him. Still a better play than lighting your money on fire, but it's not remiss to shit on him in the long term and not expect FB, nor his immediate business ventures to thrive.

"Please post all pertinent details next time: expiration date, strike price, and put/call of each option leg.

In short, as someone else said, this graph is probably not taking into account the bid/ask spread. However, it could also be a short-term pricing anomaly that you've been quoted that would not fill  at those prices in real life, creating a larger potential loss and lower potential profit.

It looks similar to this: [https://optionstrat.com/build/iron-butterfly/TSLA/220318P845,-220318P850,-220318C850,220318C855](https://optionstrat.com/build/iron-butterfly/TSLA/220318P845,-220318P850,-220318C850,220318C855)

In general, those strategies do exist. The strategy setup in that link is much like a lotto ticket. Small chance of a large payout with a high chance of a small loss.

"&gt;Tesla is the shiny new toy but ironically it also feels like a toy to many.

People ridiculed the iPhone for the same reason when it first came out.

&gt;other car companies will regain market share rapidly

Tesla doesn’t have to maintain their market share for the stock price to soar. [Apple holds only 13% of the global smartphone market but they capture 75% of said market’s profits.](https://www.imore.com/apple-takes-75-smartphone-profits-despite-13-market-share-says-report) That is due to a combination of their huge margins, the ecosystem they’ve built around the iPhone, and the fact that the smartphone market has been growing exponentially since the iPhone was first introduced in 2007.

The same is true for Tesla. EVs currently make up less than 9% of global auto sales and less than 3% in the US. Imagine when EV sales increase to 50% of automotive sales. That would be more than 15x growth in the EV sector. Even if Tesla’s market share shrunk in half (which it won’t), they would still grow by more than 8x.

Combine all this with Tesla’s unprecedented margins in automotive sales and their vertical integration and you have a recipe for exponential growth. If you think TSLA is overvalued now, prepare to have your mind blown over the next decade.",positive

[Please note that only one of these examples (NFLX) are today valued primarily for the thing they started for.   AMZN is valued for AWS, not its online bookstore. TSLA is valued for the AI as much if not more than its mere production of electric cars. AAPL is valued for the iPhone, which replaced the iPod, which itself was more valued than the Mac business. And even NFLX is growing more by becoming a content *producer*, not merely a streamer. I'll throw in MSFT, too, whose value now mostly resides in cloud computing more than merely selling software.  None of these things could have been predicted at the outset. Its retail investors are, in a real sense, simply lucky that the companies had managers and staff who had both the thought and the capability to pivot when the time came (or at least, such as in MSFT's case) before it was too late, unlike Kodak.  I doubt whether it's really possible to truly predict who is going to be able to have the moment where a new and sometimes unforseen opportunity arises and be able to seize it properly. Even people that have managed to do so once can fail to repeat that victory later.  Good luck, and if you really want a shot at that kind of explosive growth, try options.](/r/stocks/comments/qmcjt8/stocks_with_great_growth_potential/hj8uyns/)

[&gt;I am a value and technical investor and swing trader  Value investors invest in blue chips like AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, JNJ, KO, etc. as well as growth stocks. They do their due diligence.  Technical investors do their due diligence.  Swing traders aim to buy low and sell high in a very short time. They do their due diligence.  Most of your picks are swing trader stocks but you're treating them like a value investor would treat a decent company. On top of that it seems like you're not doing much research other than looking at what random idiots on reddit say. With swing trading and even technical investing, you should have an exit strategy. For example, a common one is to sell half once you get 100% profit. I hope you didn't lose too much.](/r/stocks/comments/qlotrn/i_cant_get_the_hang_of_letting_my_winners_run/hj662io/)

"[Yes. It also is usually a good indicator of potential volatility.   Like I said, the market average PE is 15-18x. So you can think of a company that is above 18x PE as expensive, and a company below 15x as cheap.  The reason why a company may have an elevated PE, is that they are growing earnings, and therefore may grow into their current valuation. Higher growth translates to higher PE, and as growth slows, the PE contracts.  On the opposite side, companies with low growth opportunities (value) like NUE or VZ have below average PE ratios because they are not likely to grow, but are not usually shrinking either.  Negative PE signals either trouble, or the company is investing internally.  What you really need to understand, is that the high growth high PE names like TSLA at 403x are basically massively overvalued on the assumption that at some point in Tesla’s future they will grow their earnings 20x from what it was this year. Yes, you read that right, in order for Tesla to return to a market average people are betting that Tesla with grow earnings in the future 2000%.   If, at any point in the future, Tesla signals that it’s growth is slowing and they will not meet that lofty 20x earning growth target, the stock will plummet. Say that happened tomorrow, (god forbid something tragic happen to Elon), a return to market average would see the share price go from $780-&gt;$40. Seriously. That’s a 95% loss.  Now, that likely won’t ever happen, and TSLA will continue to grow, but if you compare that multiple to something like AMZN with a 57x PE, AMZN looks a lot cheaper, and a return to market average would be roughly a 65% loss.

"TLDR..

What are the chances of Tesla succeeding with Robotaxis in 3-5 years?  IMO, you can gauge this by the amount of far fetched bullshit products and timelines Elon Musk is throwing out.  Tesla's success has been in the model 3/Y... and overpriced FSD vaporware... and that's it!  Their energy business is seeing minimal gross margins, and is really only there so Tesla can over-order battery cells and lower price per cell, improving vehicle margins.

Robotaxis is the only moonshot Tesla needs, so if Musk is promising all sorts of new moon shots, then the likelihood of Robotaxis anytime soon drops.  Let's see...

* Optimus (because Musk thinks he's Eldon Tyrell and can't help but copy names from sci-fi tv/movies)... Musk claimed it could 'exceed Tesla's vehicle business'... just like their energy division was going to exceed Tesla's vehicle business.  Like other companies haven't been working on robots for decades, but Tesla and their 'genius' CEO and 'best in the world' engineers will solve what others have been working on in a matter of years.🤣🤣🤣🤣
* Cybertruck (because copying Blade Runner is Elon's thing)... supposed to be here in 2021... possibly coming in 2023.  FYI, Cybertruck robotaxis don't make any sense... but they will use up a lot of Nickel based battery cells.  😂😂😂😂
* Semi and Roadster... possibly coming in 2023.  Supposed to be here in 2019 and 2020 respectively as promised to those people that ponied up between $20k and $250k deposits, and all of the youtubers that earned a $250k roadster referral reward.  (Tesla doesn't pay for advertisements)  These will use Nickel based cells.  Meanwhile, Tesla's making all their money from LFP packs.  4680 pilot production is behind schedule.  😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣

&amp;#x200B;

Let's be honest... the only reason Tesla's seeing ANY financial success right now is because they setup shop in China, China gave them every dime they needed for a huge plant and all sorts of extra benefits, and then Tesla bought every cheap LFP cell they could find in China.  The US acted quickly to tariff the fuck out of Chinese vehicle imports; much to Musk's chagrin.  Thus we have Tesla Austin.  Europe gave zero fucks and allowed Tesla to flood the continent with cheaply made but competitively priced vehicles, potentially fucking over their local automotive industry and jobs.

Which is why Q2 is going to suck for Tesla.  It's their Chinese made cars that are driving their margins; especially those shipped to Europe.  They just lost production of 40k - 60k vehicles in Q2.  Sure, they'll rebound in Q3 and Q4... TSLA will probably go back up to all time highs, and then it's recession time.",positive
"The nice thing is that we’ve jumped up so much already that we could drop $300 and just be back where we were like two weeks ago. $860 is a fine price for long term holders, now that I’ve seen TSLA at $1,220 I would be happy to buy more at $860. I was tempted to buy more in this run up, but I’ve learned my lesson from last January and decided to just watch and see what happens. 

We all know where this stock is heading over the next ten years, I am totally fine with this being suppressed as long as possible so I can buy more.",positive
Glad I didn’t buy TSLA calls today 😂,positive
"When TSLA was in the 1k-1,200 range, I expected a 5:1 split.  

3:1 today makes sense to me, as it keeps the share price in the sweet spot of $200-300, where average employees have good accessibility to whole shares (Tesla's ESPP does not allow partial share purchases).

For example, consider a factory worker earning 50k/year, who sets aside 5% of their paycheck to participate in the quarterly ESPP.  Quarterly they'd be setting aside 50k \* 0.05 \* 0.25 = $625 to buy TSLA shares at a 15% discount.  That works out to roughly 3 shares at today's prices.",positive
"&gt;If $tsla dips considerably tomorrow I’ll be kissing my $amzn $aapl $ARKG and @abnb stocks goodbye and loading up on more tesla! Kind of excited.

Most sane $TSLA investor.",positive
Yeah that's what I'm going to do. I'm moving to London in around 2 months time so I'm just going to save money (rather than buy TSLA) now and take a breather to be able to spend it in London :) thanks so much for the encouragement.,positive

[Pretty much what your OP said, there would be a ton of ripple effects. I think you know the answer, as you said AAPL, AMD, NVidia would be in trouble. I agree, anyone who deals with TSM.C will pretty much be fucked for a bit and that definitely is not reflected in their share price.  I have invested in the past in BABA, 2015, but I sold it in 2016. I tried reinitiating my position this year when Munger announced his position, but to be honest, this time it just feels different to me and I got cold feet and sold out making like 10 bucks, lol. CCP is hurting their biggest players to flex their muscles. People will just call this FUD, but yeah, I don't like the structure of the Chinese stock market (e.g. shell companies/we don't really own the stock) and I think there are great American companies to invest in. Sure, they may be just as crooked, but at least there is some level of transparency/recourse. I say this as there have been many class action lawsuits, that have been successful, for investors for executives misleading the shareholders.  However, most of the downvotes in this subreddit just come from people not liking you talk negatively or objectively about an asset they own. My overall hedge is just getting INTC now, as I believe if something does happen to TSM.C, Intel would most likely take over that spot if they can execute well with their new factories. People often forget, not everything has to be the ""BEST,"" and there is a huge market, for a huge part of the population where mediocre is OK. I think they said on Steam, most people have either a 2070 or 3070, like 50% of the users.  I think the overall general consensus is when INTC catches up to TSM, TSM will be years ahead. I also personally think that INTC is a great candidate for a lot of boomer policy makers, as it's the name they know.  Either way, this is a long post of just rambling, but I hope it helps. Been a long term investor in NVIDIA/AMD/AAPL/and just added more INTC to my portfolio this week. I had a smaller INTC position before.

[I think most PC enthusiasts see that AMD and NVDA will/already is the leader in their space.

I think if you ask an enthusiast/expert in a field, you can get some good companies to invest in, but it's pure luck on how well it would be.  Now, if Apple isn't what it is - a tightly integrated company, and they spun their chip division off, I would throw my money at it so quickly. They're clearly the best ARM chipmaker there is. If they're releasing the chips to be built in normal computers as well, I'd wager INTC, AMD, and NVDA would be in some serious trouble, but Apple is not doing that.

[NVDA had earnings in ‘15 and I saw it was an A-plus company, watched it climb from $19 to $30 and bought in. Only wish I had Jamie Dimon access to low-interest cash to have bought more.   AMD was shakier, way back when, was $45, fell all the way to below $2, peps bought on the rumor it would be acquired. Then Lisa Su did her magic, and I bought in, but didn’t have the same conviction. I should have held esp after it climbed to $13 when it was added to the S&amp;P 500 index. &lt;~~~ that is a tell-tale sign to buy in.  I hold the same conviction about MSFT and AAPL, both are trillion dollar co today.

Be mindful that it's not expected to be profitable for years, and that the risk of being a chinese stock remain.  Don't like TSLA at all at the current valuation. If it drops 50% it could be interesting, though. Personally I do like DIS, although one should be mindful of the risk. Don't like ABNB at all at the current valuation.

"TSLA needs to succeed at something on the level of curing cancer just to make it worth it to pay the price it already has.

If you are going to do some valuation and put serious amounts of money at stake, it helps to have a solid understanding of something like P/E Ratios.

Figure out how much profit TSLA is making.  Note down the cost for a TSLA share.  Find some other companies making the same amount of profits as TSLA, note down the cost for shares of those.

It's going to be like 1050 VS like 50.

That's OK if TSLA somehow manages to multiply its profits by selling 300 times as much stuff as it does now.  That's not what your slight bump in order volume is going to do, though.

Even if you are right, and TSLA scales up its profits by 300x, lets say it takes 10 years to get there.  At the end of those 10 years, the business looks like it's about topped out.  There's not much growth left in it.

What do you think it's share price is going to be, at that time?

If you guessed the same as today's price, you are right.

Even if it achieves all the big dreams of the TSLA fanboys and changes the whole world, that's not a reason for the share price to go up from the ultra hyper insane level its currently at.

That's the meaning of ""priced in"".  It means people are paying as much for TSLA shares now as they would be paying for it if all their TSLA dreams had already come true and TSLA already conquered the entire world.

This is a big deal and it's going to bite a lot of people in the ass.",positive

"I just don’t understand the logic of betting your whole account on one option. I lost a fair share of money early on with “yolo” bets but I would never take 100% of all of my savings and essentially hope that I don’t get screwed by an earnings call. When I first started with options I did make some moves that lost me a good amount of money, like 1 or 2k at a time. After missing on a few of those I decided that most options plays (specifically non LEAP plays) were essentially gambling and I would never be comfortable going into a casino and losing 2k. I did have a couple of nice pops (AMD, UPS, and TSLA come to mind) but options really are mostly a boom or bust type of thing.

You do have my sympathy as it seems that you likely read stories about buying a weekly and that lead to a 10x return but you should take the advice of others and rebuild with those 390 as a base; perhaps begin to DCA into an ETF with 390 a month in order to remind of you of your mistake?

[1. They are using Boston Consulting Group and there has been extensive research done on them and why this is BAD for a company. I'm not going to go into detail but if you follow the trail of BCG employees that become executives at a company, you will find out more for yourself.  2. Jim Cramer told you to buy NFLX in January which if you've been following along here is also not good. The time to begin shorting was the moment Jimmy Chill told you to buy, in January.  3. Netflix suddenly wanting to enforce password sharing rules is odd to begin with. They completely changed their tune. In March 2017 to promote their original series Love, they tweeted ""Love is sharing your password"" - my assumption (not based on anything other than BCG is poop) is that this is likely their idea to tank the company.  4. It will be impossible to even enforce password sharing properly. If a person is traveling and using their account, obviously they won't be in the same location/their home as the rest of their family. Or as one redditor brought up, his daughter used it during sleepovers and has every right to do so as part of the family.  5. Everyone up in arms about ads has every right to be. The biggest selling point of Netflix at one point in time was cord cutting and no commercials. However just be aware that it's not likely your current Netflix plan would suddenly just add ads, it will probably be like Hulu and offer a cheaper plan w/ads.  6. I just woke up and don't know why I even wrote all this stupid shit as you're all a bunch of degens and will just buy 0DTE puts come Monday.

[No doubt! I don't mean they will become the next Enron or anything like that. But they do need to keep ahead of the pack by doing something ""meaningful"". Doing this a la carte profile upsell is really going to be diminishing returns. To me this just smells like fear and danger is written on the wall.  The CEO has said we need to take the punch bowl away and need to tighten the belt. Fed is raising rates, lots of dark ominous clouds are forming overhead... Its going to be another sink or swim moment for them (I have been a continuous subscriber since about 2002 or so, 20 straight years of helping them and I don't plan to stop). But I am not holding any NFLX shares for many years since I have been HODL'ing AAPL.  In my honest opinion, I would come work for them for stock (I don't need the money), but I would tell them they need to do something else. Something totally new, a new service that has not been done yet. They will need to create a new market for entertainment and have the first mover advantage in that new area (thats the only way to survive).  * They already transitioned from physical to online ✅ * They already setup a streaming platform ✅ * They already created their own winning content creation ✅  So what is needed next?? I'll be honest with you, this passwords/profiles upsell is just them running out of ideas. They need to come up with something that Google/Amazon/Apple will chase after because those guys will need to play catch up ALL OVER AGAIN.  I would even say Roku is in a better position to eat Netflix's lunch today... Roku has physical speakers and other physical devices that integrate their own stuff and their own streaming. If netflix goes to ads based it will be like... whats different with hulu now 🤷🏽‍♂️  I have some ideas kicking around in my head that I have not seen anyone do for entertainment. But I am sure the smart folks at Netflix can come up with better ideas than I ever could. I want to see a new segment to generate revenue that everyone needs to sign up for as a ""must have"". Something that screams... I want to pay Netflix another $20/mo on top of the $20/mo I am currently giving them today.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uam96u/its_time_for_shorting_gallore/i5yxyon/)

I mean most people just use youtube for non-movie stuff and thats free.  * I pay $1/mo right now for Hulu with ads * I paid 3 years up front for Disney+ when it first came on the scene for $120 flat * The only reason I still keep NFLX active is because I made so much money on them over the years that it paid for some cars and a down payment on a home... i basically made a free lifetime subscription to nflx so i feel guilty to pause it even tho I just don't use it.  What is unique to the Netflix platform that isn't the same for about a dozen others just like it? 🤷🏽‍♂️ Right now with them trying to skin a dead cat to create a revenue stream from add on profiles is along the lines of desperation like me trying to cut back on expenses by eating ramen/mac N cheese instead of Wagyu steaks...

"I actually sold going into the weekend, not because I'm not bullish on Lac just according to my trading plan I always sell at 100% and wait for the stock to cool down then buy back in. I'll let you in on my dirty secret, LAC has been following the growth surge in Tesla so almost to a tee LAC will follow the volatility swings of Tesla. NOTE, it doesn't happen everytime and its not the best way of making a play however its worked almost every time for me.

Onto the option play in detail, I saw Tesla start its run up in October so I made so 3-6 month option plays out and nothing greedy either I had strike prices at $32 and $35. Here's the MOST IMPORTANT factor on the option play, since Tesla has way more volume than LAC, LAC is usually delayed by a few hours or days following the swings. So when I saw TSLA take a hit and drop id sell my option, wait for LAC to drop and it did, I'd rebuy my option with like a 30% discount. Catalsts I saw to rebuy in was oversold at like 11% earlier this week and Tesla starting to rebound and re rally. As long as Tesla is holding its current price or shooting up I didn't sell because I knew LAC would ride the growth up even further. 

You combine the great deal news today winning the bid and Tesla shooting up today you get huge positive movement in the stock. If LAC drops a decent amount again and I can get a discount Ill buy back in but right now I cant see any short term catalysts that'll keep LAC at this new all time high. You can make a LAC option play just know you're paying a premium if you buy a call on such a huge run up. LAC is a great options money printer, be greedy on your position but dont be greedy on your returns. Cheers and good luck to you!

Tldr: LAC follows Tesla's volatility, make your plays off of TSLA stock movements and sell when TSLA dips hard and rebuy when TESLA rallies harder.",positive

[Hmm.. I am in the stock market for only 4 months and I never talked about a market crash..  There won't be a crash, I think people are missing the fact that while the stock market has been going up a lot, it is mostly the big companies that have been pulling the weight upwards.   Think how much MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, TSLA and NVDA have gained YTD while the VTI hasn't done even close to most.  YTD:     VTI is up 22%.     AAPL is up 28%.     GOOGL is up 66% (GOOG about the same).     TSLA is up 38%.   MSFT is up 50%.   NVDA is up 129%.  These are only part of the companies that pulled the stock market up this year and they are massive companies, look at how the rest of the stock market is doing in order to lower the percentage gains of those companies.

[It's been a very interesting past 2 years, to be sure. Some of the disturbing amateur trends I have witnessed:  1. People asking about 'safe' stocks or 'blue chip' stocks like MSFT, AAPL, TSLA, NVDA... none of those are safe nor are they blue chip!  2. Black and white thinking, and decisions made on 'absolute' thought processes. I hear people say things like ""I never sell until I double my money"" or ""Never buy anything but tech"" or ""Don't catch a falling knife"". Truth is, each opportunity should be judged on its own merits and every opportunity is unique.  3. Assuming that their luck will continue this way forever. Just because they made money during the past XX months doesn't mean things will continue.  4. Thinking that they know how to invest based on under 2 years of experience.  As someone who has been doing this since 1990 (professionally for the first 20 years), let me tell you ... inflation is like a shallow cut that won't heal. It bleeds enough to annoy the shit out of you for a long time. A quick death would be better. (monthly inflation numbers are announced this Fri, if anyone cares). Inflation is finally being recognized by the government. Be warned.  Anyways, there's my part of the rant. Peace out!](/r/stocks/comments/raujkn/when_the_shoeshine_boys_talked_stocks/hnoi11b/)

[Some good responses here. One thing I'd add is that it can be tricky to use this method to actually enter the stock when it's a longer expiration.  If you say ideally wanted it to be exercised on you at say $130, and it hit that price in the next weeks (The put being In the Money) - it might not actually get executed because, in this hypothetical scenario, there's a lot of extrinsic (time) value till March expiration. The long party might just hold, and then price could spike back over $140 and it could turn out that was their only chance to exercise the put.  So you have to be fine with the tradeoff of getting the premium, vs. the possibility of the stock crashing and you being long at a high cost basis, or actually wanting to get in and eke out the premium, but not getting exercised. This is AAPL so it crashing far below the exercise price seems unlikely, but the scenario I'm laying out (where it's briefly in the money, too far ahead of expiration, then bounces back, strikes me as not unreasonable.)  Selling puts is fine if you're purely trying to capture the premium and avoid getting exercised whatsoever, but not always great if you're trying to 'get paid for buying the stock'.](/r/stocks/comments/rb9o0m/very_basic_put_selling_question/hnnte43/)

KEYWORD : AAPL DATE : Wed Dec  8 00:45:03 2021 SUBREDDIT : stocks



[&gt;Of course I should enter this contract only if I'm okay buying AAPL at $140/share and I should keep in mind that AAPL could be trading, say, at $0 when I pay $140 to buy it, at that is the biggest risk, right?  Yes, the biggest risk of selling puts is the stock crashes and you buy $14,000 worth of shares that are now worth a fraction of that. Or, you buy to close the contract at a **large** loss. This is unlikely with AAPL which is why the premium is quite low in contrast to more volatile stocks.  It's also worth considering you need to lock up $14k until march to only get $234 unless you buy to close earlier. That's not that great, at some point the put is too far OTM and you could make more money by simply buying some shares.  $14,000 worth of AAPL shares only has to go up by 2% by march to give a larger profit than selling this particular put.](/r/stocks/comments/rb9o0m/very_basic_put_selling_question/hnounc8/)

I chart out each ticker on the hourly time frame and execute trades using 3-5min chart based on support and resistance zones and it works pretty well.

[A slight digression from topic at hand, skip if you like. :-)  How many hours a week do you put into this?  Most tech companies will start you at 6 figures.   And provide a hell of a lot of benefits.    In 6 months you could have a fairly solid background in AI.  And then write your own ticket.   It all comes down to: at the end of a week, based on the hours you put into drawing lines on a screen, what was your hourly?

When you drop $75K on MRNA, you are not leaving that screen. Not for a second. The swings are crazy. In minutes.   TL:dr.  It’s pretty tough to day trade full time with less than $250,000.

haha I know! But she is the one who makes money of the two of us and really quite supportive of putting money into tsla!,positive
"Hmmm - I think your math is off.

TSLA was around $70 a share in Nov 2019 around the time of the CT reveal.

$1,000 investment / $70 per share = getting about 15 shares in your portfolio.

TSLA closed today at $658 per share.  $658 * 15 = $9,870.  10x return.  Not 100x return.",positive
Do ppl post YOLOs anymore? Havent’t seen a good one in awhile. They used to come with savant level analysis or just be straight up TSLA FDs. Or some obscure security like orange juice and ornamental gourds… take me back,positive
Well I think they've said TSLA is def not working with mvis,positive
"lol you said it is taking over when it clearly is not.  it cute how people treat tsla like it will dominate.  

it's taken years for tsla to hit 310k vehicles.  Ford sold out a 3 year supply of 200k lightning trucks in a couple of months.


if the time line was equal.  ford just absolutely crushed tsla sales.  that's just one product.  I'm In a ford  fusion titanium hybrid that has some of the mustang  trims.  it's a sweet ride.  when comes time for me to go full EV.  ford will be on my shopping list again.

tsla while innovative.  it also has elon meme status.  when the competition ramps up more.  tsla will  stabilize for a small slice like everyone else.

p.s.  gm had full electric in the 1990s  long before tesla existed.",positive
"You’re right but growth is the play right now and people smarter than you and me like it in the near-term. Just letting people know it might be a good opportunity to make a nice trade.

Edit: Forgot r/stocks hates TSLA",positive
"Only holding one share of Tsla and my dick, hopefully tomorrow is a greener day.",positive
"Read the chat. I posted that i was looking to enter TSLA above the 8 EMA, and it timed perfect. The stock was RS all day. I used the 8 EMA to enter the trade and it took off.",positive
Plot Twist: Musk wants to sell 10% of TSLA at sky high prices but needs an excuse.,positive
About $21B will come from Musk the rest is financed by Morgan Stanley. The $21B from Musk will presumably come from TSLA shares that he will sell for cash. When he makes that sale he will need to pay capital gains. You don’t pay tax on stock unless you sell it.,positive
"Well excuse me dr Burry but that seems like a foolish investment

You wanna bet against TSLA and you're worried we won't pay you?

Well this is TL, if you offer us free money we are going to take it",positive
"Done for the day.

Made money on AMD, TSLA, and SPX. No losing trades but my GS short still F'ing me.",positive
"I'll tell you my largest position (about 70% of my portfolio), but you'll have to read through a disclaimer first:

I'm not a financial advisor of any sort. I am not responsible for your financial success or failure. 

There is no quick and easy. Everything I invest in is super volatile, and if you don't do your own due diligence and research, you won't have the knowledge and conviction necessary to make good decisions. Without strong convictions, investors make stupid, emotional decisions like buying and selling at the worst times.

So with that said, most of my money is in TSLA. Check out /r/teslainvestorsclub and the Tesla Daily YouTube channel if you want to investigate further.

I used to have most of my money in AAPL, which grew 20x from when I bought it in 2009. I still hold a few hundred shares for sentimental reasons.

The remainder of my portfolio is in early-stage biotech companies that are super risky. They could grow 100x or crash to 0. I watch these companies closely and manage my position sizes appropriately.",positive
"Looks like a sus grouping if you ask me.  Seems a little convenient that Silver, TSLA, vanguard real estate amongst others are in that group.

Cathie Woods (ARKK) seems tied up in this too somehow between getting involved with robinhood, not to mention the 20 year treausury bonds that burry was short until he mentioned moving to the 30 year (only saw him talk about it on twitter, havent checked his 13F filing yet)",positive
i feel like tsla will close well over 1100,positive
"Theoretically it's less about people buying EVs and more whether Tesla's valuation is justified by it's ability to capture and hold that market.

Lmao nevermind TSLA only goes up",positive
My naked tsla put at 680 only need 10k margin on TDA. Thats amazing. Do you have even lower margin requirement with Portfolio margin?,positive
"I would stay nimble in this environment. I've been trading TSLA options. I could care less whether it goes up or down, because I'll still make money.",positive
"One time? He was right on shorting magicinternet money @ 60k, Long GME @ $5 and shorted TSLA at $900. I bought tsla weeklies for this earnings but I’m well aware Burry has a proven track record.",positive
"Lol GLJ research announces that they are opening a short position in TSLA, the next day it moons 5%. Too perfect 😂",positive
"From an investment POV most of the companies which will drive change are already here and well established like TSLA, ENPH, NEE etc. Then you have tech giants working on automated electric cars like apple and Google. Once climate change becomes more mainstream expect big oil and gas/energy companies to take over. 
You can invest in a fund like ICLN but I don’t expect it to outperform SPY.",positive
"yep this is my understanding as well but I think the bottom is 950.

edit: after taking another look at today's open interest chart ([http://maximum-pain.com/options/TSLA](http://maximum-pain.com/options/TSLA)), I am optimistic that we will stay over 1000. It seems to me that the main call spikes have moved to higher strikes and there are now more puts at 1000 than calls. The MM will still be selling a lot of hedge shares but they probably already started that process yesterday so the dump might not be as intense today as it could be. I admit I am a total newbie at interpreting these charts so any corrections or insights welcome.",positive
"They will be profitable this year. I like tsla, but I think their stock should only trade around $300. People are discounting cash flows with 30% or more growth rate for the next 5 years and they act like it's impossible that it won't grow that fast. 
They are saying they will make 5 million cars and sell every one of them in 2025. All they need to do is double their entire manufacturing, then double that again, then grow another 25% in 4 years. If they do that, the stock is worth 1800, which still only reflects a 17% cagr. It's bonkers how over valued the stock is, and how high the expectations are.",positive
"Great day to short LCID, UPST, and my darling TSLA",positive
Of course D-Bag Matt Wallace jumps on. Elon has said next to nothing since about TSLA accepting Doge. When and if Doge is accepted is up in the air and unknown.,positive
"It really really depends what you tell them your goals and time horizon are. If you say “I care more about high returns than minimizing risk and I have 30 year time horizon,” they should and do basically let your longs ride. If you say “I want the money to compound but I don’t want large drawdowns and I may need some of this money in the next 10 years” they should have a lower equity allocation and rebalance after it appreciates significantly.

I personally think most Financial advisors are complete bozos and doesn’t sound like this guy is doing anything for you you couldn’t do yourself. 

The fund has now underperformed Russell 1000 Growth and SPY for 3 years. However looking at top names it looks mostly reasonable. AMZN MSFT GOOGL NVDA TSLA MA. 

I personally wouldn’t bail completely here. Maybe reallocate half to 3/4 SPY and 1/4 IWD or VTV? (Value funds)

Hard to say without knowing what the rest of your money is in.",positive
I’m going to bed and when I wake up in 3 hours TSLA better be at $1104 where I decided it was a good idea to get out on Friday so I can get a redo,positive
"SPY was at its lowest volume today of the last 2 months, only 59% of avg.

Of the top 5 only TSLA was above avg on volume. MSFT was only 71% of avg.

51% of the S&amp;P value is in the top 5.

Yet SPY up 1.16% on these geh volumes?",positive
Praying my 0DTE TSLA $1050 calls go ITM tomorrow 🙏,positive
Totally - and you will. I think a solid 5 year hold for you would be a fantastic result. If you can stretch it to 7-8 that would be ideal however you’re in amazing shape regardless pertaining to your TSLA position.,positive
I bought it on Friday. Some of the longest battery life of an EV and plenty of ex=TSLA execs. Looks promising.,positive
"Tbh, its a bullish sign for us every time ark is selling tsla. They are fully transparent. Pretty sure Ron Baron is doing it too but no one is talking about!",positive
"$30T? Still super bearish.

https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/super-bull-future-tsla-valuations.238220/page-2#post-6424931

$375T by 2030.",positive
My entire portfolio is red but it just makes me happy to see TSLA drop! 🥵,positive
"they're saying the ""MOASS"" millions of $$ per share will be because of shorts closing and no one selling

they're also saying that GME fundamental price could equal TSLA's, or AMZN's

Like just look at what TSLA and AMZN do

now look at GME NFT marketplace.....

like literally no one wants NFTs. It a field that is way too Wild West and nothing, but sketchy shit. Look at all the lawsuits revolving around it and how many scams/money laundering.",positive

[I’ve been watching PLTR for almost a year now and I have to say this:    Palantir stock is as bad to investors as cancer is to your health. The CEO and creators literally do not give a shit about profits, revenue, or even public opinion. The creator literally only wants to give the US an advantage over other countries when it comes to analyzing data, he’s said it in interviews before. Most of their current revenue is Military/govt contracts, and anyone that knows about that kind of business model knows they’re is very little profit margin. They we were rich as fuck before starting PLTR, they’ll be rich as fuck after PLTR peaks (if it hasn’t already).    I would not hold my breath waiting for this stock to moon. If you want to invest like a boomer and buy this stock, hold for 10 years and maybe see it double, by all means. IMHO, there are literally hundreds of companies that are a better buy than PLTR.](/r/stocks/comments/qpmor1/pltr_ceo_sells_16m_worth_of_shares/hjvjubi/)

NYSE:CEO DATE : Sun Nov  7 22:22:29 2021 SUBREDDIT : stocks



[That post is correct. This will also ensure that when he does sell to cover the taxes of his options that he is about to exercise, people don't panic sell cause of a big CEO sell off. When a CEO decides to quietly sell off a big chunk of their business that means they probably believe their company has reached its peak and are cashing out. If Elon did that out of the blue without anyone knowing it before hand, Tesla would have a huge panic sell off.  So with this poll he is basically trying to avoid that mess of when he does sell it it in the coming weeks/months, it was expected and not out of the blue. IMO he is playing this wisely for his reputation and for his shareholders.](/r/stocks/comments/qowk4z/the_absurdity_of_elon_musks_poll_to_decide_to/hjqrlqt/)

[I have had my eye on LZ for a few years now (before they IPOed). They are trading at an insanely rich valuation for a company that effectively doesn’t make money and has been around for years. But what they do have is a giant customer base since they do about 1 out of every 10 entity formations in the US. That’s their golden goose- their giant customer list. They don’t make squat off legal services.   They brought in their new CEO Dan who was a GM at Intuit, and effectively cleared out their old management, and replaced them with former Intuit execs. They plan on cross selling accounting services to their customers who are typically new small business owners. Accounting services is a natural complement services with far better margins (think of it as services offered by traditional mom and pop accounting firms and not H&amp;R Block or TurboTax level self service).   I’m waiting for an entry point as I think their value is too rich and they won’t be making substantial profit for awhile.](/r/stocks/comments/qp43uv/legal_tech_stocks/hjrkkb6/)

Tesla changed the mission statement in mid-2016 from  

&gt;“to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable **transport**.”

to 

&gt;“to accelerate the world's transition to **sustainable energy**.”

Tesla's mission statement is due for another update if Elon aspires to encompass **AI robotics** as an important part of the company.",positive

"That account is literally just the PMCC, a few MTTR leaps, and (now) enough cash to meet that minimum. But I have other cash, accounts, assets, etc., although it is kind of aggressive to put 30% of my net worth into two TSLA PMCCs.

I only did it cause I got out of GME and thought it would be cool to buy 100 shares of TSLA less than a year ago, just cause I never thought I'd be able to to do that, then I realized PMCCs are always a better leverage (buy 2 calls for the price of 100 shares, sell to CCs instead of one).

(by manipulation I do not mean anything unlawful or bad, it's just if I have enough Money I can more easy set a trend on it...though, not me for sure)  Anyway. What worked out for me is to have a look at the East Asian and Australian Markets, how did they start? Then go West until your Market opens. But keep in Mind: the US Market is the strongest worldwide so if rest was red and the US goes green it might set the shift for the next session, same vice versa.

[&gt;Growth, on the other hand, provides an informational asymmetry that Wall Street can’t efficiently price.  So retail traders can win in that game.  In fact, retail traders can outperform in growth because they have more collective experience on the product side that Wall Street can’t buy.  Totally agree. However I think it is slowly being eroded. I've noticed funds like Baillie Gifford are good at growth investing, I think it's actually probably not that hard if its your day job and you know what to look for.  I think that this information asymmetry edge is actually a difference edge in disguise. I think the real edge retail has is the volatility, because they can hold on to a business that they know is good in the long run, even with step drops. Even the very, very best equity hedge funds, like Tiger group back in the day, have a lot of pressure to produce consistent results.  I held onto AMD through a 50% drop once, decided to buy more, I wasn't being super brave or anything, I just knew the issues were temporary. Anything institutional probably isn't allowed to do this even if the analyst knows.  The market might be an even better hunting ground now than Buffetts time, because there are so many more stocks to look at, and the incentives haven't changed. In fact, the usual incentives now have these algorithms they can pour money into, so there's probably less eyeballs and brains actually valuing businesses based on real world information relative to the opportunities available.

Let me ask you if/when rates rise and say the 30yr gets to 7% where I believe it will be in 18-24 mos. how do you maintain a portfolio where the avg coupon for 30yr is \~4%?  Do you just hold everything to maturity?

"Right but we are arguing the same thing on different sides of the coin i drive a truck that can tow a house because when i need to tow a house or a machine that weighs as much as a house i dont have an issue should i be taxed because of the vehicle i own well i already am when i put $200 worth of diesel in it every fill up just as you are when you charge from empty at your home 

Look I dont have an issue with electric cars but the community around them is ridiculous especially the $TSLA drivers cult and from what ive seen most are self righteous and a good bit of them drive like they’re shit dont stink 

But what we should be arguing is why insurance for my 1/2 ton diesel truck that can pull a house is less expensive than my 4 door or better yet why is it so expensive in the first place

And secondly i dont have a problem with people modifying they’re car because at the end it’s theirs to do with as they please and i take that stance knowing whats going on in other states regarding car mods and most are just strictly govt overreach",positive

"&gt;Currently Tesla is the best car maker by any reasonable technical measure.

Absolutely not.

Their batteries and self-driving tech are respectable (despite often being over-hyped). However their quality control is dogshit compared to their market competitors. Panel gaps. Shoddy paint. Door misalignment. Issues which you wouldn't expect in a $25k Toyota, let alone a $50k+ luxury vehicle.

r/realtesla is full of stuff like this. You don't hear about it elsewhere because criticism of the company gets shut down by fanboys who are trying to get rich after turning $TSLA into a meme stock.",positive

TSLA 960c 11/5 God dammit,positive
"thanks for the informed, reasonable take. I certainly see your side of view. 

Tsla fits that niche of car shoppers that are into the niche tech / specs that it does better than others (faster acceleration, best battery tech, autonomous driving). while lacking in some other niches vs other luxury brands, such as interior cabin quality, suspension, steering feel, etc. 

will Tsla become the dominant car brand that becomes mainstream choice with most market share? just as Apple is in the smartphone biz. many car makers are jumping into EV space left and right. in 5 yrs, besides autonomous driving which I concede that Tsla has comp advantage in, I dont see how other car makers cant compete in this space. issue with competition is slower growth, lowered margins, and thus much lower investor sentiment. 

the reason I think Tsla is risky over longer term is that it has $1T market cap and competition is only going to heat up.",positive
"Great, thank you!

There seems to be something weird about how I'm seeing comments show up here - or maybe everyone else just deleted theirs for some reason - but I've gotten a couple of other replies via Reddit email that agree that the math seems correct, so that's heartening. I've also been reading some tax articles online (yeah, I party hard) and they also seem to agree. Basically, our AGI would be $105,900 after I sell tomorrow, then our standard deduction of $25,100 would bring that down to $80,800, which fills the 0% tax bracket for long-term capital gains, netting $0 tax liability. Crazy, but checks out.

TSLA did split, and I actually have more than 200 shares, but the particular lot I'm referring to has about 200 shares (bought 40 in 2017 at $349.60, which split to 200 at $69.92 in 2020), so I just tried to keep it simple. The important point is that my cost basis should be the same for the whole lot at $69.92, so the math should be straightforward.

Thanks again!",positive
"TSLA will also be in a dogfight when more manufacturers continue to pump in EV models, and won’t have a loyalty, reliability, or tested production lines of legacy manufactures, but yet *still* is worth more than 13x more than Ford despite having a fraction of their vehicles on the street.

"[I get it and not taking it personal. I used to own RIMM back in the day (blackberry if unfamiliar). After the iPhone and then android supported phones took over and stole the market from under the nose of RIMM, they basically tried to pivot to a software company.   Not exactly the same scenario but there seem to be some parallels.  I have been a ROKU skeptic and I still can’t figure out why their prospects basically as an independent developer get any better. I used to have a LG smart tv and I hated the interface. Tbh I switched to Samsung 90% bc the interface vs the Sony I was also considering. So the interface matters. Shoot I used to use the Netscape browser back in the day. I bet ROKU goes the way of Netscape at some point. Not worth it to be acquired and not truly scalable.   This could be an American point of view since I don’t know how smart TVs in other parts of the world work and if they prefer a 3rd party interface. I see it as always being on the fringe of streaming and as a business, content costs are going up to attract new users. As a small player, it’s definitely a huge cost for them compared to the giants which barely notice the additional cost.](/r/stocks/comments/qzp76p/why_is_roku_falling/hlqbk39/)

"[You don’t see how it’s consistent? I just explained why. Bezos and buffet and Zuckerberg are also in the top 5. My point isn’t that Tsla and Msft are the only good companies and that they’re the only ones you should ever allocate to in this way. My point was that you could do this with any company that fits a certain profile. Tsla and Msft are definitely two of the best examples. They’re better than the others mentioned right now because they’re performing better for recent gains. At some point with rotations it would make sense to rotate to an aapl or amzn but I wouldn’t reccomend it at the moment. FB is likely the best one to be rotating into right now.  Expanding on reasoning and strategy isn’t the same as moving the markers.  It may seem that way if your strategy interpretation would be to hold forever and die with your shares but that’s not a good strategy. I apply this type of strategy to a quarterly trading period where holdings are most influenced by the market sentiment to them for their most recent and upcoming earnings. Sector rotation is common for investing. High weighting allocation is common. Emulating high performers like Buffett is common. Allocating to high liquidity is common.  I do think it’s good practice to follow what works for extreme wealth generation instead of sitting on tiny gains that barely beat inflation ya.  And no I wouldn’t allocate 50% to just anything even if you really understand it.

And it never came remotely close to reaching its previous lows. This all happened with absolutely no change in TSLA fundamentals, no announcements, no new products, no good news. TSLA was merely heavily shorted at the time of the dividend.  GME is in the same boat now. Market cap, future, and fundamentals aren't near as valuable as Tesla, but the shorting situation is many times worse. So I think that gives it a lot more run up.  I don't think GME will reach fundamental valuations of Tesla, but keep in mind GME has a tiny market cap for what it's trying to attack.

"PHEV’s count, this is as big a fallacy as saying Tesla won’t sell all the cars they make. 

Anything that gets government incentives to consumers or avoids penalties are absolutely competing with Tesla.   

I excluded hybrids like my Prius and high mpg pure ICE cars for that reason although they definitely pull in demand from the environmentally conscious crowd that can’t afford a BEV.  

As far as FSD, Solar, TESLABOT’s and other nonsense goes, I just ignore it when I look at TSLA.  

Tesla does need to deliver on a truck &amp; a cheaper CUV if they want to stay competitive long term in the U.S. &amp; they need to build quality cars and provide good service.  

They have 1 1/2 models that account for 95% of their sales &amp; provide bad quality and even worse service.   They need to make significant progress on both if they want to continue to justify their current valuation. 

Those are the keys.  

There are 3 key markets:

Europe/China-Asia/U.S.-North America.

"[IMO Azure is not value for money. Offerings can be buggy and new/useful features arrive late.

Product wise it is never a match for Slack.  I hope decision makers(ppt guys) realize that just because they use (are okay with) windows or laptops come preloaded with windows doesn't make it a great OS. At least it is not a great development environment. Most people I know like to code either on Linux or Mac. If you're hosting on Linux, better be coding on that.  No wonder MSFT had to buy Github when they can't build cool stuff like that. They might have to go on a shopping spree if things continue like this.  Moreover, they have the potential of taking a product like Skype and then make antique piece out of it in 10yrs. One of my colleagues recently commented Gitlab should be thankful that Github got acquired by Microsoft. I sincerely hope Github does not meet similar fate meaning. At least both can co exist.  My experience with MSFT has me believe that VS Code that I like this much was not a great product until it got open-sourced. My advise is MSFT should open source their cloud and other offerings too. If they can get a freemium model working, the quality of their products will improve.  Excel which is one of Microsoft's good products has stiff competition product wise. They could have made it better with native Python support instead of VBA but no.

[No I mean Microsoft Sentinel, their new SIEM. Sorry I should have clarified.  Sentinel One would be a competitor to Defender for Endpoint.  I see what Microsoft are doing. You can either spend more money on a multitude of different security services each covering off different things, each with their own contracts, pros and cons, problems with integration/interoperability. Or just roll out Microsoft, everything just works and unlike a few years ago their security tools are now on par with years long industry leaders like Splunk. Just imagine in another 5 years. Enterprise AV is more less dead in the water now with Defender for Endpoint. You need a decent justification not to just buy an E5 license from MSFT and use their suite of tools over splurging on something like Crowdstrike and a bunch of others to achieve the same effect. Plus, who isn't using Azure now. Everything is moving from on-prem to Azure. And so once that's in place if you want a SIEM to collect your logs you've already got one, Sentinel. You just pay the subscription and voila, it's practically that easy. There's obviously a huge community for all the MSFT tools too. Why bother with anything else.

Most of your strategies on taking advantage of the situation is either shorting very specific stocks, or investing in specific plays that would likely benefit from this new atmosphere.

After years of investing in index funds, I decided that losing 5% of my total holdings would be a risk that I could stomach with no problems.  Just want to point out that if you have money in an index fund like VTI, you got those big Google, Microsoft and Tesla rises today.   To be fair, you also lost on a number of other companies.

[Perhaps.  In 2001 GE was the largest company in the world by market cap (over $400 B).  In 2006 GE's market cap was $359 B, and they were the second largest company in the world.  In 2011, GE's market cap was around $210 B and they were 6th largest company in the world.  Today, GE's market cap is around $114 B and they aren't in the top 30 of largest companies.    Using Microsoft as the example, MSFT was the largest company in the world in 2000 with a market cap of around $492 B.  Fast forward to 2005, and Microsoft was the 3rd largest company with a market cap of around $267 B.  In 2010, MSFT was the 2nd largest company with a market cap of around $260 B.  Today, MSFT has a market cap of 2.43 T and is the 2nd largest company in the world (just behind AAPL).  My point is that stocks have to be monitored and positions adjusted.  There is a good chance that the leading stocks of today, won't be the leaders in 5, 10, or 20 years.

"Meh.

You have some familiarity with quality stocks that you trade. Why follow the dumb money into low-return index ETFs?

Buying and holding quality growth stocks long term gives you compound, exponential growth, which is where the real magic happens.

And you don’t have to worry about the unpredictability of short term stock moves, like you do as a short term trader.

By quality, I mean companies like TSLA, AMD, and MSFT that have multi-year growth runways - not meme stocks. (OK, maybe not necessarily those *exact*stocks. Do your own research.) Build on your stock knowledge. Get to know the *businesses* and where they are heading 5-10 years from now.

I have a larger portfolio than you. I’m 80% in TSLA stocks and LEAPS, holding them long term with no plans to sell. TSLA stock grew 150% over the last 12 months. My LEAPS options grew 150% just since September.

I’m also still holding some AAPL I bought in 2009 and that’s grown 20x. That’s what long term compounding does.

I only use a small portion of my money to sell options for income. 

I don’t touch the majority of my portfolio. I don’t risk my buy-and hold stocks by selling CCs. 

I let Elon, Tim Cook, and a couple of biotech CEOs work for me, giving me compound, exponential growth.

Broad ETFs are fine if you don’t know what you’re doing. QQQ is actually a very good long-term hold.

But if you can find high quality companies with high rates of long term revenue growth, those companies can deliver life-changing returns if you can ride out some volatility.",positive

"&gt; Some misunderstanding by retail investors about RIVN: Just because F and AMZN backed RIVN does not mean they will be giving RIVN free money OK? IF that guarantees that RIVN can finance with future rounds (good thing), this will dilute your shares

Who is claiming they are getting free money? Rivian has raised capital from both Ford and Amazon through various rounds and now has around $18b of cash and equivalents on hand. They won't need to raise further equity capital for many years.

&gt; Unlike TSLA, RIVN is ONLY a car company. TSLA produces solar, batteries, software, soon Lithium

That's not true. 

Rivian is working on stationary storage, has a heavy software focus (for example see FleetOS), and is planning a cell factory as a top priority. 

&gt; We know nothing about Scaringe.

Well he's managed to build a company currently valued at over $100b and bring onboard some of worlds largest investors. He also has a PhD in mechanical engineering from MIT.

&gt; In 2030 TSLA/RIVN Car production only = 20x. Let's say Elon is too optimistic about 2030 and Scaringe is conservative, let's say it is 15X
Currently the market cap is only 7.8 X half of production ratio.

That's a really strange way to relate production to market cap. Surely it's more logical that if Tesla is worth ~$1t today with production volumes of 1 million vehicles per year (which took ~9 years to reach after the Model S) then Rivian should be worth a similar amount in 9 years time when they are producing 1 million vehicles?

Your method of valuation effectively attributes no value to Rivian's growth potential post-2030.",positive

2. It appears to be based on the 55% CAGR projection and the anticipation that TSLA will still be worth a premium for all the future things they have in the pipeline.
3. Just looking at the number you are forced to ignore inflation and zero-risk rate of return.

Do I think Tesla can increase profits at a rate of \~55%?  Nope.  Do I think they can increase them at \~85% in order to compress the P/E to a suitable level?  Nope.

"[You're not really helping the company much by buying their stock except for helping raise the price, but you're not buying $AAPL to help it grow or give it the 160. When stocks IPO, they have a set amount of shares they can sell and that's when the company will get their big bag of $$ usually. From then on they can look to sell more shares in a secondary offering, but you're not going to really help the company itself.   Regarding stocks vs crypto, I will start with saying I don't personally believe in Crypto so I'm biased. When you buy a stock, you are buying something with a balance sheet and metrics that you can use to value it and judge if the stock is worth buying or not. Looking at AAPL, you're able to see how many phones/computers/iPad's they sold this year. You can see growth metric and how their healthy their balance sheet is. When you buy Bitcoin, there are no metrics that can tell you if it's undervalued or overvalued and there's also a lot less transparency &amp; regulations in the industry. You can argue that you can price bitcoin based on the cost of electricity, which i think is a valid argument. To me though it's just pure speculation. They also are more volatile typically when comparing to solid companies in the S&amp;P/Dow.    To finalize my rant, I would recommend that if you want to be involved in the market and don't fully understand it, or follow it, to just buy some Index tracking ETF's. You can dollar cost average them (You put in ""X"" every month consistently. Some months you'll buy more others less, but you'll average out a good cost over time). If you do want to try buying single names that's fine but please do your research and buy things you believe in. I tell anyone who asks me for stock advice to buy companies they use frequently and think will be around in 20 years. Don't follow the crowds to try and get a quick buck, you might win but you'll more than likely lose. Also, re-invest dividends. The compounding after a couple years will surprise you and it's easy to do on your brokerage usually.

[Apple management also receives shares as part of their salary package, so they benefit from a higher stock price. Furthermore, when Apple buys back shares, the profits have to be split among a smaller number of shares, so the dividend increases. Furthermore, management may receive bonuses based on the performance of AAPL stock.  EDIT: In 2021, Tim Cook's salary was $3 million. But he also got $82 million in stock rewards. That stock reward is only so high *because* of the higher value of stocks, *and* because he received a larger number of shares due to hitting stock performance targets.](/r/stocks/comments/syx9nk/what_value_do_i_bring_by_buying_stocks/hy0ihh6/)

[I used to run a fantasy baseball league with a pot that regularly ran up to $3000. I actually learned a lot about picking value as a result. What I've learned is that going against the grain is the best strategy for potentially big gains. So when everyone is a run on closers, I'm looking at the best hitters available. When there is a run on catchers, I'm looking for the best pitchers. You still need  studs to anchor your team AAPL, GOOG, etc. but you also need to pick some little guys who will eventually become studs on your team. When a player is hot and it doesn't seem like he can keep it up, I'd sell him for a struggle player.

[Again, getting burned back then (despite having recovered by leaps and bounds since) left a mark. Maybe because it was because it happened during my formative years. Either way, I distinctly remember a lot of the same rhetoric; that's why I put significant fractions of my portfolio into established blue chip techs such as CSCO and INTC. I also remember the same talk about share values reflecting really optimistic future growth numbers, as if the only alternative was total and complete bankruptcy (which is just such a poor model of the outcomes that I don't even know where to start).   I've been an AAPL shareholder since like 95/96; I've made a metric ton of gains on that investment. It doesn't mean I really trust that the share price will stay over like $160 (I expect it to fall back to $130-145 because I *know* that sooner or later their growth rates will fall, especially in the face of the semi shortage, and previously over-exuberant investors are going to punish them for it). You might ask; why don't you sell and rebuy? The answer is simple; it's a very significant position that I will incur an equally significant tax bill on. The tax bill might honestly eclipse the price difference, leaving me in the red just for the sake of doing some (what I see as) bullshit trading.  disclosure: as mentioned, I hold shares of CSCO, INTC, AAPL](/r/stocks/comments/sxfyqa/the_bubble_has_already_burst/hxyepxw/)

Absolutely. Tech sectors do very well even In a correction like this. If tesla was to dive tomorrow you'll see enormous returns in a year. Tesla is in a short neutral pattern again. I'm thinking tsla  might be in  a down ward  trend. If it can pass 900 again I would definitely invest. But if it starts going down I would hold not sell and pick up more tesla at a later date. People say a correction is about 15 percent but the stock market hasn't seen an event like this so I'm guessing 18 to 25 percent but then we are talking possibilities. The event is probably the housing market bubble popping houses are dropping tens of thousands of dollars and evergrande is pulling stock assets and the people at the top are about to start running. Be safe don't be an ape. Amc is correcting  and will dive after the pump. Amc is hard to borrow on think or swim but if your on the htb program it's easier to borrow. I don't have enuf money in my account to effectively short amc. My range is 12 dollars to 20. Any ways give love.,positive
"So far you would’ve been able to roll ccs up and out of any gamma squeezes.

"once you pop the hood on TSLA beyond mainstream curation and fluffy-youtube-vlogs, you realize this is still an incubator of a TaaS and EaaS future. Automobiles were the proof of concept. The final form is a global energy utility and transport platform. Tech companies rarely hint at their final form in their proof-of-concept-stage (who was buying AMZN as a bookstore?).

AKA your market share is NOT just hardware (which will almost always lose market share over time, silicon valley knows this), but the amount of miles driven on the platform, and skimming off energy usage via arbitrage. Opening the charge networks after they hit a critical mass is a clear example of this.

(coincidentally the very same royalty clause from Westinghouse ($x/hp) that would've made Nikola Tesla one of the world's richest men....except he agreed to remove the royalty for Westinghouse to 'survive'.)

Their last earnings cut p/e in half. p/e does not mean shit anymore. I was buying AMZN with a p/e of 1000. I got called every name in the book by the Value crowd. Every tech company has an insane valuation and then fills the shoes extremely quickly because that's how tech companies scale (Exponentially while the human mind thinks linearly (see: Second-half of the Chessboard)

[Now would be a good time to short Tesla or buy other automakers, if that's your thesis.  Considering how GM killed the EV in the 90s and Elon Musk revived it in the 10s, I come to the opposite conclusion than you do.  Toyota is lobbying against EV's. Volkswagen has diesel gate.  Maybe you are anti-car, but within the automotive sector, it is difficult to find a cleaner company.](/r/stocks/comments/pjng0j/elon_musk_says_tesla_tsla_is_worth_3000_a_share/hbxm2jg/)

"The most recent increases, sure. But Tesla deliveries were taking about 2-14 weeks back in March. Several customers that ordered around then certainly took delivery before the end of Q2. From the start of 2021-April, the M3 and MY both increased by $1k. 

I’m not arguing that they’re profitable on a per-unit basis - they certainly are now. But that only started Q2 ‘21. That profitability is partially scaling, as you said, but it is also partially impacted by the price increases. And prices have been increasing for long enough that quarterly results are already showing the increases. A 1k increase alone is significant with how much volume Tesla has been putting out lately.

The top five market-cap constituents of SPX are: AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, GOOG

The top five market-cap constituents of QQQ are: AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA, GOOG

However, the top five in SPX add up to about 20% of the total index, while the top 5 of QQQ add up to about 38% of the index. So they have more influence on QQQ, which would cause some deviation in price movement vs. SPX.",positive

There will always be a need for brick and mortar - and these two, as general retailers, are killing it. Plus they both pay a respectable dividend (between 1.5 and 2% yield)  QQQ or SCHD - QQQ more growth focused - SCHD steady payouts. SCHD more for risk adverse.

[VOO  RIO  NIO  BP  EDIT: I’d like to explain my choice as well.  VOO is an easy pick and could also be easily replaced with SPY (but I prefer VOO for lower cost), with this one I am exposed to all relevant US companies.  RIO is mining company with excellent dividend with headquarters in UK and Australia, and operating in all continents (or most, not sure about this, but they are widely present). They are also undergoing expansion, especially in lithium mining and maintaining their iron ore production which is mainly being bought by China. Need for ore in China is constantly growing and I don’t see this changing in the next 10 year period. RIO would be my stock of choice if I could invest in only one company, mostly because of their long history, stability and high dividend yield.  NIO is basically just a high risk Chinese growth stock. But at a current price, they have much more upside potential. What I like the most about the company is their completely different approach to batteries in cars. I think their future will be focused on battery swap station (they own patents) more than EV. They are already leaders in battery swap business in China. Recharging batteries in EV’s is just not a sustainable model, as even if we advance in fast charging I don’t think we could beat their swap time of 5 minutes. Not sure how it works exactly or if it’s completely true but their page claims their vehicles have free lifetime warranty (quite confident about their product aren’t they?).   BP is one of the most relevant energy stocks in Europe. It would be hard to choose between this and XOM, but BP already showed it’s intention to move forward with their green energy program and they will be forced to focus more on that sector as Europe is moving to that direction much faster than US. I think they will suffer in the process, but they are already one step ahead US energy companies. Once their huge oil capital settles in green energy, they might become growth stock in the next 10 years. Also they have decent dividend. Russian conflict will also force them to focus more on alternative energy sources, but they have enough money to invest in it. Only problem is their mental CEO, once he is gone, the stock will skyrocket.  I like to invest in stable companies that are looking into future the same way I do, and that’s electric. Everything will be electric in the future no doubt. But we will need lot of materials and oil to do so. That’s why I choose BP and RIO that are moving towards sustainability. I also like to take some gambles and I think NIO is the best gamble.   All of those are my actual investments with RIO and VOO being the largest holdings. Also have QQQ,VXUS,XLI and SQM (SQM is my biggest winner so far, wish I’d put more money in it, but has some considerable risk to it)](/r/stocks/comments/t1hm76/you_can_only_own_four_stocks_in_your_retirement/hyg3mqm/)

"Low vol day.

I doubt Elon sold much if anything today. Could be related to veterans day and sec being closed (such as Tesla / Elon prefer to not have to do an earlier submission to SEC because they are closed today and they just did a shit load of docs).

Could be Elon and co. are trying to reduce the impact on the market / tsla or for more of a premium for his hard earned and well deserved shares.

Considering the submissions to sec indicate this was a plan set in place back in September I'm guessing they put a number of strategies together that probably play out differently based on market reaction. Since Tuesday was rather traumatic they likely pivoted to a lighter strategy over a longer period. Elon isn't doing anything without SEC being well informed first as he'd rather quickly end up in prison otherwise.",negative
"What many TSLA bears dont see it is its auto pilot modes and pricing powers. Auto pilot is going to be another game changers: i.e if technology is perfect, one can go to work only to let his/her car making money doing taxi services brining side income. 

Sure there are still many challenges to complete auto pilot mode that we know of, meaning human dont have to get invovled in any seconds. 

Once this is done, TSLA will be able to quantify auto insurance rates to each drivers meaning they are making additional cash flows by selling insurance. Note that i pay the same amount of dollars as my auto insurance annually worth for my 12 year old cars that's never going to be used but only to pay up for boomers who own stocks in alstates. 

TSLA will bring disruption on auto insurance which is a big chunk of undistrupted territory so far (perhaps lemonade is the closest one) if they complete auto pilot modes. 

AAPL, NVDA, GOOG are still planning to establish autopilot driving anyway and that should tell anyone this has high stake in future alpha. 

Pricing power means they can decide MSRP. No more hussles going to price haggle with oppresive salesman at dealership but simply place an order at tesla website and wait. 

What other conventional auto makers do? Ford does direct selling limited mustang E but that's about it. 

If you make enough income (6 digits), who will be primary consumers being able to afford TSLA model, then one of last thing you want to do is to see salesman in dealership and price haggle. For Tesla's potential consumers it's not about price that matter but more about experience. 

Sure conventional auto makers such as Volkswagen and Hyundai can split the EV as much as iPhone and android divided smartphone market shares but that only means tesla will thrive even more from here. 

I mean... Closing out Tesla's position is like selling out AAPL in early 2011 just because there was southern europe financial crisis and post GFC uncertainty during which AAPL finally caught up for 20 baggers until late 2021.

"Can some options masters help me figure out leaps.

I want to shuffle things around in my portfolio so I have exposure to the upside on TSLA but I don't want it to be tying up so much of my capital.

If I grab June 2023 300C. They cost about 38k with a delta of 91 and a break even of about 670-680. So does that essentially mean I'm exposed to 91 cents of upside for every $1 the stock goes up and as long as the stocks above 690 by 2023 June I'm not at a loss (I buy 100 shares at 300)? Just double checking I understand it properly. I'm thinking of just grabbing a few deep ITM leaps and freeing up about 40% of my cash (I'm 100% TSLA Right now).

Does it have any effect on margin risks and maintenance as compared to shares?

&amp;#x200B;

Also on a related note, wtf is the point of selling calls at such low strikes. These are June 2023 so they are new expirations / strikes. Selling TSLA 100C makes no sense to me.

"I sell credit spreads mainly on AMZN, tsla, ba, goog, or nvda

If the charts of those tickets look like crap, then I just theta burn on the indexes until a proper setup comes

When I sell spreads, I usually go all in on weeklies that are way out of the money

So for example if amzn is at say 3500,
I sell weeklies at 3150/3000, $15k spread, sell like 20 of those , cash it out once I hit 15 to 20% profit

If tsla is at 1100, I sell weeklies of 750/600, 

For indexes, on NDX Or SPX, I sell weeklies that are 10% below current price, this gives enough room for any crazy over night tweets, wars, political FUD, FED policy changes etc

I NEVER sell spreads on stocks with P/E ratios of 100+, exception is nvda and tsla because they are market leaders in their segments

"Tsla is 100% beyond dot com bubble.

It's P/E is at 405. Its actual revenue is a fraction of other car manufacturers yet they have a valuation so excessivly inflated is genuinely is not funny. It's terrifying.

The difference between tsla and dot com is that dot com wiped out $5 trillion across hundreds of companies. If, or rather when, Tsla stands to meets its fundamentals such as Netflix and facebook it'll singlehandedly wipe out 15-20% what the dot com bubble did. We're talking almost a trillion dollars.

I think you have a bit of a sampling bias. Tech has been getting the same amount of trash approval as dot comm the ENTIRE tech market's average P/E is 30. That is such an insane forward trading for the entire market, and there's tons of stories pouring out of silicon valley of total garbage startups getting insane capital. It's not like that was the only bad ideas from dotcom either. Companies like dell didn't collapse and were fundamentally sound, yet they were as overinflated as amzn (per the fundamentals vs speculatives). It was the combo of shit and overinflated solid companies that made dot com that bad.

We're definitely back in a dot com bubble, but this one is far more top heavy so we don't know exactly how much moneyis at risk, but it's closer than I'd say investors want to admit, simply because doing so could trigger the collapse.

Hell, NFTs are basically the same unmetered market investing as $SHIT like you made an example of. It's all different because tech is different, but the rampant speculation, reckless investing and overstretching of funadmental companies and crapshoots alike are scarily dot com-esque.

Think of future similar to call, but instead of option you are obligated to buy the stock at price on the expiration. So, in above case you will have to buy TSLA at $1200 on 31st Dec 2022, and the seller will have to sell it, regardless of the current price.",negative

"TSLA is a great company but is valued against even the best of its competitors it would sell for 50% less than it is today. Very overvalued and the most cult-like of the meme stocks.

Tim Cook is a much better CEO and manager who keeps everything running smoothly on a steady upward trajectory. So genius does not = good CEO and Musk is highly eccentric and fickle.  He also tweets personal feelings and opinions which is quite unprofessional.

Bitcoin may be created by a huge waste of electricity but it essentially worthless in that respect You can plug your EV into it. The electricity is simply wasted. and it pollutes badly.

"[My 2 cents.   I remember looking at HITI last year before the reverse split and was debating putting some big monies into it. On paper it really was probably one of the most promising things I've seen in a while.   The thing that really irked me was they had a set price for companies to buy their stock at y price for x time or # of shares (I cant remember specifics).  I was very concerned with market dilution and on top of this they were acquiring soo many companies just to do things a ""little"" better and to buy out competition.   They are now opening stories like crazy and posting record profits, but the stock price is still going the wrong direction. I have to wonder where the all the money is going. If its more infrastructure; this could likely be the best stock in the last 20 years, and the best time to buy in would likely be within the next 3 to 6 months as the price will likely continue to drop. It makes me wonder if this is the reason why they went through with the reverse split in the first place?   Does anyone have any additional insight? Any additional info would be greatly appreciated. I haven't been keeping that close of an eye on it.  You can PM if we want to keep the bad vibes out of the forums.   Speaking from experience I came across something like this years ago. It fundamentally shit the bed as well, while being the thing ever on paper.](/r/pennystocks/comments/v3nr11/hiti_ceo_wins_award_as_1_competitor_ceo_steps_down/ib4f9z1/)

Cantos was exposed as WSBGOD 2.0.  Of course he was fake, he was out here shilling ScamBot like Dalton shilled Fake Whales here for months.  At this point, if you believed him, your asshole must look like a 3 month old jelly donut after Rage Cakes practiced his sex offender fingering techniques on it.

You let fake money get destroyed. TSLA is _barely_ over $1,000.  And you somehow broke our beloved L2F…  he's out here writing in lower case letters like a paltry dick bitch.  

Also, how much crack did you guys smoke to [upvote this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/r7mrh3/aapl_evs_and_the_dead_jobs_bounce/) 100 times?   You seriously can't expect me to believe that didn't involve crack.

On top of all this, I find out some of you have secret clubs and haven't invited me.  Giorgi, that escargot licking Frenchman, was using up all his anytime minutes texting Cantos from Europe but I never got a text.   La Heffa👸🏼 has a discord but I wasn't invited.

I make fun of ModsRGay for being so poor he has to live in the poor part of Queens (speaking of which, him and SocialSuicideSquad are the same person, right?

"There is confusion around the original post because some people assumed the OP was erroneously referring to the normal early end of the trading day as ""ending GME early"". His post is actually referring to the fact that AH was scheduled to continue until 5pm yesterday and GME stopped trading at 3:36pm which according to (1) OP's anecdotal info is correct and (2) MW is correct but **according to Nasdaq the last GME trade took place at 4:58. (Edit: Thanks** /u/HuskerReddit **for the Nasdaq time &amp; sales data)**

According to MW : Note also that DOW stopped at 4:44. Nasdaq at 2:16. CLX at 4:37. MRNA at 4:59 TLSA at 4:59 also.

According to Nasdaq DOW stopped at 4:12 MRNA at 4:59 and TSLA at 4:59

(stopped referring to last trade placed data - sorry not cherry picking stocks, but NASDAQs website UI sucks so I had a hard time finding CLX)

Hmmmm there may be something to this but it may also be a industry practice. Maybe no one was buying, no one was selling. Maybe certain data sources/brokers stopped after a certain time. Maybe a MM got margin called and failed. Maybe it is fuckery. but there is more to it than just GME getting ""turned off.""

How can it be up 60% in the last month without hardly any news?

What the fuck is going on?",negative
"Some of y’all don’t get it. 

If a divided equals a percent of a stock, you want to have more stocks. A stock split lowers the price of entry, which means you can purchase more of the stock. While yes, the initial dividends will be lower, the split stock tends to grow at a rate higher than that of the stock prior to the split. Market psychology drives the price higher. Which is why I bring up TSLA, unless you lunatics really think TSLA would be worth $4.3k right now if it hadn’t split.",negative

This is a screener. Don't trade these without looking more into them.

&gt; What is f(OI)?

I was poking around heuristics for identifying gamma ramps a few month back and settled on this function. But mostly, I noticed that whatever function I used (even just total OI), I'd always get more or less the same stock at the top so I stopped fiddling with it.

I think f was something like the OI-weighted standard deviation of the geometric mean of option price to underlying price.",negative

"&gt;  just sell naked and buy back the calls if its itm at expiration?

LOL. And if the buy back is 5800% over your collateral? How do you think buyers of OTM calls make 5800% gains? It's because some seller has a 5800% loss.

&gt; Kinda dumb question but why is it called poor mans ‘covered’ call when you dont own the underlying? Im confused what will happen if the calls that you sold are exercised.

TSLA shares cost $847 each. A covered call requires 100 shares. If you don't have $84,700 cash to buy the 100 shares required to run a covered call, you are a ""poor man"". 

However, a poor man might be able to afford a deep ITM call with a far expiration. That might ""only"" cost $270/share, so you'd ""only"" need $27,000 instead of $84,700. You can be poor but still get the benefit of a covered call. That's why it's called a Poor Man's Covered Call.

If the short call is assigned, you receive the strike price in cash and will be short 100 shares of the underlying stock. It is then up to you to cover that short position, which you can do by selling the long call. You may not make enough to cover the entire short, though, particularly if the value of the stock goes up before you can sell the call.",negative

"Technically you're losing money on the unlimited turbo call as time goes on if the underlying price stays flat.  The invisible theta decay on an UTC is the increasing probability that the investment goes to zero if the barrier is hit.

My guess is the market maker selling a European UTC is internally backing them with American style options as the TSLA option market is often bigger than SPY, and that huge liquidity allows a market maker to construct whatever risk model they'd need to offer a product like a European UTC.

Assuming one figures out the underlying mechanics a market maker is using, you can probably cut out the middle man and save a few % here and there on premium.",negative

"Reasonable to expect a multi-week bounce off an extreme move like we've seen the past 6 straight weeks.  Longest down streak since 2011.

But the bubble in equities/bonds was so big that it's hard to assume this is the final bottom and we go straight up from here.

I still expect lower lows in the next 4-5 months given elevated valuations in the mega caps that need to converge with rest of the market.

A bigger retrace on AAPL, TSLA and the rest would bring us down to S&amp;P 500 around 3300-3500.

Key factor is bond yields, any break above 4+% on 10 year yield would cause breakdown in mega caps.

If bond yields hold at 3%, this may be the final bottom of this bear market but I'm skeptical given magnitude of inflation + size of bond bubble.  Is there enough buyers at 3% yield when Fed allows runoff?",negative

The Waldorf school isn't a perfect experience, but they focus more on growing self-confidence and emotional resilience, which to me are critical for becoming complete human beings. They pay attention to the social health of the whole class and take steps to resolve bad situations.

Wtah do you guys think of tsla,negative
"&gt; the angst over the ebbs and flows of PLTR is way less than TSLA.

I'm also a TSLA investor from the early era.  I bought my shares the year before initial Model S deliveries began.  Still hold them today.

PLTR is unquestionably less dramatic than TSLA was at a similar market cap.  

For those who haven't been following Tesla/TSLA for a long time: Tesla was nonstop drama, mostly because the vast majority of the mainstream believed the company was going to flop, and there were relentless attacks from trolls, shorts, and Mainstream Media as a result.  

The uncertainties around Tesla were enormous.  Would people continue to buy their cars?  What crazy thing would Elon say, do, or tweet randomly?  Could Tesla scale to mass manufacturing?  Would competitors make better products?  The problems that Tesla faced were so extreme, and Elon Musk so controversial, that it was almost a given that shareholders would experience enormous mental pressure.  It wasn't until 2020 that many of these questions were resolved in Tesla's favor. 

Palantir has a focused CEO who stays off social media, a software product that doesn't require a complicated physical supply chain and manufacturing infrastructure, Billions in cash, and zero debt.  I consequently have almost no concerns about Palantir as a business or PLTR stock.  

TSLA was so crazy that I'm pretty much inoculated against whatever rough patches PLTR goes through.",negative

"haha yea. no matter how good u are, u cant pick only winners. its crazy that she would drop billions of capital into HOOD, ZM, Roku, Tdoc etc etc while selling Apple and Tsla to raise cash. 

maybe her picks will work out 5 yrs from now, but she is letting her fund be exposed to insane amount of concentration, risk, and no downside hedge at all.

"and that's absolutely normal with a SPY drop like this because SPY isn't the only ETF that contains TSLA  


QQQ also dropped significantly, as did almost every single ETF that contains TSLA  


This is exactly what's expected when the entire market dumps 2%+ in a day- every underlying stock drops around 3-4x what the market does because they're all interconnected.  


AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, FB, GOOG, AMZN, NVDA all have exactly the same charts today. Almost like they're the top holdings across the market or something.  


When an index drops, everything in the index also gets dropped. When multiple indexes drop, everything in them drops twice as much.

"Is this a fucking ""gotcha"" attempt?

You stupid fucking hick. Go actually do some research on the company and the wider market before you open your fucking mouth.

P/E is overvalued in every company right now, because of inflation and a LOT of speculation in derivatives. But because it's basically nearly every major company... it's effectively *no company is overvalued* (until the next crasherino).

Tesla takes that overvaluation and shoves a shit load of illegal fireworks up its asshole and sends into the fucking sun.

It traded with a P/E of over 1000 *multiple times*. TSLA trading at 50 bucks a share is still overvalued, relative to other companies.

&gt;130-135 IQ is not exceedingly intelligent.

That's cute.  My point was that you're NOT exceedingly intelligent, hence why you mention it.  The entire post was basically calling you a dumbass Ina round about way which was laced with sarcasm.

&gt;Nothing to be insecure about, I'm rich af for my age 🤑🤑🤑

Good!  Enjoy it.  We're not jealous and we don't think you're cool.  You're embarrassing and childish.

&gt;Anyway, I'm not really interested in talking about myself, but you keep bringing it up so I have to respond.

I brought you up one time in this one post.  There are multiple posts where your insecurity has you trying to convince us that you're rich and intelligent.  It's difficult to believe you aren't interested in talking about yourself.  Just look at your own name here on Reddit!  ""Hurr durr, I'm young and I want meme numbers of stock in a company that seems cool to kids.""

&gt;I see you still won't engage me in TSLA specific discussion. Hmm, I wonder why that is?

What's there to say that hasn't been said?  You believe the stock will ""moon"" and many of us feel that Tesla is not worth it's market cap.

"&gt; “I heard that Powell is going to raise interest rates by 1% at every FOMC meeting until the end of time”

I will eat my own dick if the fed raises rates by 100bps at ANY meeting ever. 

Yes, they will raise rates a little this year. But 100bps is an unprecedented and MASSIVE increase. I’m not even sure that they’ve fully tapered QE yet. 

Sure, avoid overpriced tech stocks (TSLA, etc) and weed stocks are going to keep disappointing until congress can pass a federal banking legislation act (or legalizes it, or Biden gets it rescheduled), but there are plenty of very reasonably priced stocks still that won’t collapse even if there is more market softness. 

Once all the retail pussies liquidate their accounts…guess what? There are no more paper handed sellers left. And that’s the bottom. 

Anyone who can’t ride out a 10-20% correction has no business investing in stocks.

And anyone who thinks they can time the markets and call exactly highs or lows…is a goddamn hubristic idiot. 

Buy quality stuff. 

Don’t yolo into the bullshit meme stocks. 

The world isn’t ending. 

Remember the hyper 10-15% inflation during the 1980’s and the 10-15% interest rates during the 1980’s?

Guess what also goes up when that happens? Stocks. Real estate. Wages. 

Here’s the annual returns of the stock market during the 1980’s:

1980	31.74%

1981	-4.70%

1982	20.42%

1983	22.34%

1984	6.15%

1986	18.49%

1987	5.81%

1988	16.54%

1989	31.48%

No they are not if you have billions worth of it, they are going to be worth whatever some else is willing to pay for it. And thats not necessarily the price of a previous trade you can lookup.

"Barrons: 

&gt;TESLA STOCK IS DROPPING LIKE A STONE. THERE'S NO NEW REASON WHY.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tesla  shares opened higher Thursday, then promptly fell. It isn't easy to find anything new spooking investors.  
...  
There are no shortage of suspects to blame the drop on. There is Twitter (ticker: TWTR),  Ford Motor  (F),  Elon Musk , China, and  Wall Street , among other things, that can move  Tesla  (TSLA) shares up and down.  
Twitter, which Musk is buying for  $54.20  a share, reported first-quarter numbers. Adjusting for a bunch of charges, earnings look mediocre. Sales of  $1.2 billion  missed analyst forecasts.  
What that has to do with  Tesla , however, isn't clear.  Tesla  investors are worried that Musk will sell some  Tesla  stock to fund the purchase. Large blocks of stock on sale can push down share prices. But Twitter results don't really change that calculus. There really isn't a reason weak Twitter results change anything about Musk's financing options.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Barron's suggested a kind of backwards-merger-arb calculation to track Twitter risk in  Tesla  stock. It's a little like a conspiracy theory on a pushpin board, but the calculation might be useful.",negative
"So I finally went away from 100% TSLA this morning. 

I was watching price movement like a hawk since yesterday and it was my assessment that TSLA was mostly going to follow the broader market, even be drug down a little bit.  I also had a strong suspicion based on certain meme stocks yesterday and their price action that the market is ready for rotation, so I wanted to make some short term plays.  Being as the Twitter bullshit is still hanging over TSLA's head, the shorts are still out to get Elon, and the first few minutes of market movement this AM was giving me serious confirmation bias, I bought 175Cs 5/20s on NVDA which I have been wanting to get into for a while.  

Thanks to trading at a higher beta I am glad I made the move.  Should we keep moving up I think I will actually convert to shares and sell some ATM monthly calls against them.  If they get called away I will pay the taxes (have some losses from this year anyways that will offset) and I will wait the 30 days to reestablish my TSLA position.   Should get me out of wash sale period and into the summer where I think the inflation story really starts to die and closer to Q3-Q4 where Tesla will prepare for its launch cycle.

That's the plan for now.  I expect more chop but this way I can raise some cash to monetize downside while staying safe from margin call and also capturing some upside from this potential dead cat bounce",negative

"[By Senad Karaahmetovic:  Toni Sacconaghi, a Senior Analyst at Bernstein covering U.S. IT Hardware, has discussed implications for Tesla (TSLA) shares amid an ongoing saga concerning CEO Elon Musk and his deal to acquire Twitter (TWTR) for $44 billion.  Musk may “ultimately elect or be forced to purchase Twitter going forward,” Sacconaghi told clients in a note today. The analyst took note of Musk’s deal to acquire Twitter which should be completed via debt, equity, and a margin loan.  Sacconaghi pays special attention to $12.5 billion that will come from a margin loan facility tied to Tesla stock.  “Following the recent drop in TSLA's stock price, Musk appears to have just enough value in his unencumbered Tesla shares to fund the margin loan portion of his proposed Twitter financing. That said, at a TSLA share price of $621 or less, Musk would technically not be able to borrow the full $12.5B against his shares - in fact, if TSLA's stock price were to drop to $500/share, he would be ~$2.5B short. If the agreed upon deal price for Twitter is ultimately haircut by 10%, Musk could still borrow enough, even if Telsa shares dropped to ~$400,” the analyst wrote.  However, the bigger - but also less probable - financial risk for Elon Musk is there is a deeper pullback in Tesla shares, in combination with him completing the deal.  “If the TWTR deal were to close today and subsequently TSLA's stock price dropped to $350-400, Musk could be forced to sell ~13M Tesla shares.”  In other words, Elon Musk would get a margin call.  Sacconaghi rates Tesla with an Underperform rating and a $450.00 per share price target as he struggles to justify TSLA's valuation, “which appears to imply huge volume AND industry leading profitability going forward, which is historically unprecedented.”  Tesla stock price is indicated to open 2.5% lower today, or at $657.90.

"I have followed $QS (QuantumScape Corporation) very intensively over the last few months and wondered about so many contradictions. Monosyllabic interviews, mysterious imprecise statements, sometimes an almost arrogant information policy, almost to the point that only a ""fake product"" comes into question. What if we're all completely wrong? To the facts that have matured a theory in me, which sounds so crazy and then is the most logical. 1. $QS is not taking legal action against ScorpionCapital's accusations. 2. Celina Mikolajczak is moving from toshiba to $QS in 05/21. This is Musk's confidant who is ""parked"" at the cell supplier for $TSLA (Tesla Motors, Inc.) to strengthen strategic influence..... and she is moving without lock-in (non-compete clause). 3. a second automaker in the top 10 blocks 70% of the samples from the QS0 production facility. 4. board of directors announces in October that 1 TW will be produced by 2030, which is the annual output of 10 GW production facilities 5. Musk and Diess cuddle so intensely that Musk even leaves a greeting at a VW executive seminar. And all of a sudden, everything fits together: My hypothesis: The cell has been ready for a long time, and in its final version. There are too many rejects and scaling is still in the process of being found. QS deliberately avoids legal disputes, since one would inevitably have to disclose the technology in a court case The top10 manufacturer can only be Ford (5%), GM (10%) or $TSLA (85%), excluding the competitive situation, all others are eliminated. Mikolajczak has moved to QS after agreement between Diess and Musk to drive scaling. VW and Tesla have reached an agreement on equal ownership. This will be disclosed before the next capital increase (capital requirement &gt;8bn euros) is due..... This capital increase is only possible when the stock market value is significantly above 20 billion euros, which would correspond to a share price &gt; 100 euros. This is all IMHO. No financial advice! My assessment: In the next few weeks, the QS share will run up to 80 euros, driven by ""unusual call options"", and then announce the disclosure. 👍",negative

The real answer is that the general public is not capable of grasping the concept. They are cultivated to not take risks and the stock market is something for ""rich people"". Also assuming you're not spending a lot of time on research, buying TSLA was nearly impossible and people should just be expecting to make 8%/year off an index in their lifetimes.

[Vince is destroying the brand. Not sure if he's firing people left and right to lighten it up for a quick sale? As a consumer, I have a lot of beef--they don't use their roster correctly, change directions randomly, and the writing/booking is abysmal.  Look what they just did to the best thing they had going--NXT. Got rid of the serious tone and gave it a 90s day-glo finish. It's almost like he's trying to ruin it.  This rant is more about the company, but they can't lose that much of their core audience and succeed as a stock without a buyout soon. And its competitive--AEW is kicking their butt and hiring some of their best talent. They talk about viewer engagement, ignoring that TV viewership is only going down.  And they need the red and blue brands performing weekly to feed the PPVs. Off the 2020 lows, it hasn't even performed that well.  On the other hand, ROE and ROC is good.](/r/stocks/comments/shokpj/what_do_people_think_of_wwe_as_a_stock/hv3xjox/)

[Too risky. I don't have confidence that they will even exist as a company 20 years from now. Kayfabe is dead. McMahon is old. He's been bankrupt before. Risky moves banned. Steroids are banned. No more jacked muscular roster. Way more entertainment options now than 20-30 years ago when WWF/WWE was at it's peak. Social media makes kids know it's fake so they're not into it as much as past generations. Adults aren't into it because of the PG direction. TV in general is dying and they need TV as a gateway to WWE network subscriptions.  They could do well or be bought out but the risk of bankruptcy is much higher than average companies, things aren't looking good with all the roster cuts recently, stock chart looks horrible from 1999 when they had a way better product. No way I'm investing more than 1-2% of my money in this company and that's only if I'm a huge fan.](/r/stocks/comments/shokpj/what_do_people_think_of_wwe_as_a_stock/hv4hcpb/)

And I was like, ""sure, I also like to set aside a bit of cash for speculative plays but the core of your portfolio should be focused on the long term.""  He asks a few more questions about what stocks are good right now. I give him some information and help him out; look for undervalued stocks that have high growth potential, recent selloff has made valuations more reasonable so it might be good to start nibbling in, but just be careful, etc.  He ends the conversation saying I sound like one of those talking heads on TV where I say a lot but nothing really helpful.

[When the talking heads start saying really outlandish things you know something is up. All this nonsense about 5 to 7 rate hikes. It's just not even realistic. Two rate hikes would put the yield curve completely flat and three would invert it.  The fed is not going to purposely invert the yield curve. One of two things is going to happen. Growth is going to really accelerate and the 30 is going to sell off allowing them to raise or the rate hikes we get this year are going to be more like one or two and then of course everyone will be surprised and you have your rally. There is no surprise. This really really feels like a ShakeOut to get new investors out of their positions and have them unnecessarily worry about a recession. In order to have a recession you would have to believe that we are going to have three four five rate hikes and inflation is out of control. Even then, what's the game plan because if you slow growth that much inflation quickly turns to deflation? Then you're cutting rates right after raising them. The FED knows all of this and probably a lot more. TV is being really misleading right now. Indexes like the Russell are off 20%. All you have to do is look at history to know a DCA approach at these levels has paid off every single time. The only one that took a bit was 2002. My own vote on this is we are going to get one or two rate hikes this year not the bullshit on tv. Inflation is going to come down for a variety of reasons including putting a little fear in the consumer. When that happens the FED will say we don't have to hike anymore inflation is coming under control. There's your setup for a back half of the year rally. I'm also sort of mixed on even posting this as I greatly dislike helping people. The smarter people get, the harder it is to make money. This one is so erroneous though. With Bank of America purposely misleading people in their most recent statement, if you get anything from what I just wrote, just think. think out the scenarios.](/r/stocks/comments/sgedvt/listening_to_market_expert_analyses_feels/huwqnwf/)

[I still think they’re at risk of Apple and Amazon turning their shit music apps into decent apps. Granted it’s been over 5 years and no sign of this yet, but it wouldn’t be hard for either of them to emulate Spotify’s algorithm. Consumers are going to get sick of having 10+ streaming/content subscriptions so will consider bundling their music subscription into their existing Prime membership or Apple membership (with TV, storage, games). It’s the same music after all, unlike streaming which now has fragmented content. Owning a few podcasts isn’t enough point of difference, even if it’s Rogan. So medium term I think Spotify will struggle to keep adding subscribers.](/r/stocks/comments/sgh1h3/spotify_could_be_undervalued_spot/huwc0mx/)

Should have stuck with my 11/5 TSLA 1000 calls. Still pissed about that sale.

AMD fucked me with puts today but my SPY LEAPS just continue to print. EOY SPY calls are doing well. Might see the 165 strike ITM by mid November. Not sure if I should sell and just take the profit at that point or hold yet.

Grabbed more TSLA shares today too. I can see it run to 2000$ by EoY next year.

Holding off on buying more DIS. Been saying it will probably go to 167$. Probably next week. Might dip below but it is a looooong term hold for me. Probably FMV is about 165 near term anyway.

Bought a little bit more WEBR, JPM, BRK/B, TGT and COST today too. Looking at NOW, CROX, CVX and, stupidly SOFI (again). I think NOW and CVX are pretty near their top (could go up a bit more), so Im looking harder at CROX.

"# Grading The Louisiana Literacy Test

**The Louisiana Literacy Test was designed so that the test-takers would pass or fail simply at the discretion of the registrar who administered the test.** The questions were so imprecisely written that the examiner could decree almost any answer correct or incorrect, at his whim.

The reality was that registrants the county commissioners wanted to prevent from voting - primarily black applicants, but also certain lower-class whites in disfavor with county officials – were destined to fail the test, regardless of the answers they gave.

Black applicants could be failed for something as simple as a single spelling or punctuation error. **However, many examiners chose to deceive test-takers by changing the rules or interpreting paradoxical questions in different ways.**

* For example, although question 5 says to “circle” something, questions 1 and 4 say to “draw a line around” something. If the examiner insisted a circle was not a line, the applicant failed.
* Question 10 asks for something to be done to “the first word beginning with ‘L’” – does it mean the first word in this sentence, or the first word on the page?
* Question 24 wants the applicant to “print a word that looks the same whether it is printed frontwards or backwards.” One would assume that a word like BOB would work just fine, but if the examiner expected “backwards” to be in mirror-writing, the B’s would be inverted and thus incorrect.
* The solution to question 25, in spite of the trick question in the triangle, could be that the examiner expected the word “down” to be written on the line!
* In question 27, does the examiner expect only the word right to be written, or does he want the word right plus all the words that follow it? And if the test-taker printed his answer instead of using cursive (“I said write, not print!”), he would fail.

Another factor in passing or failing the test was the time requirement – **registrants had to respond to 30 complicated questions in 10 minutes, a time frame which could easily be waived for white voters.**

There were limitless ways to fail this test, and t**he registrar, with the blessings of a white controlled county government, exercised complete power over the success or failure of every applicant.**

Holy shit TSLA. Just how,negative
"Clicked on the wrong thread. Ya, okay buddy. I've made a fucking ass load on $TSLA puts lol. Not holding any positions in it currently.",negative
"Agree.

If i think of all the rough patches AMD has had. The times i was convinced the most are the times i have lost the most on it(options, shit timing). If i had told other people to invest, with my shit timing, they would have likely gotten cold feet and sold at a loss, and it would have destroyed relationships.

For me, i held the conviction, recovered my own losses from the rough patches, and have made quite a bit in the end.

Like options, with investment advice, you cant just be right on the stock.....you have to be right on the timing as well, or you are going to eat the blame.

--------

On the flip side, my biggest(ongoing) loss is someone else convincing me to invest into a business with them. Sadly that was funded half by selling AMD stock at 30, and half with cash that was earmarked for TSLA and AMD. Lost opportunity cost here is easily a life changing amount.

But, i don't blame them. It was my choice, my lack of due diligence, it's my loss.",negative
I should have seen the sign when TSLA has been dropping like a rock for two days. Fuck me I guess,negative
wave2: buying TSLA 1000c 6/10,negative
"Noice, 👍👍, u belong here with other apes. 
I was like that with my TSLA calls ,ended up at -$60k negative.",negative
I mean you could have went long tsla and not played earnings in a historically volatile market and probably doubled that within a year or two tbh,negative
"QQQ is a wonderful pick for the long term, virtually assuring you to outperform SPY in a 20 or more years period. 

You may want to add some spice in the form of any or all of, say, AMD, NVDA, AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN and TSLA (they are my “magnificent seven”), but if you do it you must be ready to really believe in what you buy and suffer any downturn (which *will* be brutal) with the equanimity of a Stoic philosopher.",negative
"Could be right,  but then I just pointlessly made some coin using TA trading TSLA

One could argue the whole mkt is manipulated so...",negative
"Tsla shareholders meeting likely June 1st week, 10-1 probably, tsla to 1400

🐻 fuk",negative
"So have other corps, so many have probably died working for TSLA, AAPL, might not be reported as much.  Some things you are using are from people's blood, sweat and tears",negative
Would you short or buy put if TSLA dip below 700?,negative
I suppose TSLA is also cheap next to GOOGLE,negative
If you think it's bad now wait until TSLA reports their past quarter (Elon never sold their 🌽),negative
"AMZN, GOOG, TSLA and AAPL have the same fucking chart today",negative
Elon sending a letter to the court today asking them to stop the SEC from following up on non-public investigations centered on him is incredibly bullish for TSLA,negative
That TSLA 🟢 candle,negative
I agree if TSLA disnt exist tomorrow it would be a nothing burger but what Im saying is given Teslas market cap they can inevitably fund themselves for a very long time to come.  They arent collapsing maybe a dip on share price but even thats just unlikely the guys got horseshoes up his ass and enormous influence and a cult following.  It would take balls of steel and stupidity to bet against that.  Many have tried this play and failed.  You would need to see a momentum swing or a collasal fuckup on there part before anyone in there right mind would attempt.  Atleast hes not.stupid enough to short it,negative
"You know tsla doesn't make money, right? Why would you invest in that?",negative
"Tesla 2, baby! Time to buy more TSLA Calls",negative
"Tsla bot coming, ride the hype train till august",negative
Get TSLA short term puts and long calls,negative
"I have said the same thing elsewhere but will repeat here foe you retards.

I sat in a TSLA for the first time last week and was simply blown away by the tech.
I can say this with supreme confidence that no auto maker in this world will ever catch up with TSLA. 
They are all doomed. 
Toyota, Honda, GM, Ford all of them will disappear in 5 years.

TSLA will easily become the biggest company in the world. Buy the stock when it's cheap.",negative
TSLA to 820 by EOD?,negative
How are those TSLA puts coming along? Smh,negative
maybe the TSLA stock dividend is starlink warrants,negative

"The most shocking thing about Elon asking a flight attendant for a handie is that he didn’t ask the TSLA board.

The TSLA board would all get on their hands and knees",negative
The entire world would put their money in Stark industries. Then Thanos would come down and people will lose all hope. Market crash but those who buy the dip and hold until the reverse snap would get lambos and hookers. Lesson: Always buy the dip and hold. Calls on TSLA,negative
"LCID is a meme and not even a good one. 

If you want into risky EV companies, there are several that are actually delivering product. 

Buy NIO, hell buy TSLA. Nothing LCID has done warrants it's valuation or even future valuations.",negative
"&gt; SCOOP: SRCS say @GaryGensler's ""Meme Stock"" report delayed over @SECGov infighting. Objections involve report's conclusions. Gensler to use report as basis for overhaul of US market structure including poss payment for orderflow ban. GOP likely to pushback more now @FoxBusiness

If they somehow ban payment for order flow then $tsla crashes hard because the option volume dries up. 

Same with a lot of other names. Not even joking",negative
"Went ballz deep into TSLA calls at close. Im not usually one to put more then 10% into a trade, but I’m about to make sooooo much fuckin money.  Even if it opens down a little bit tomorrow I’m going to buy more. But it’s going to gap up tomorrow. They call me the 🌈 🐻 wrestler.",negative
I'm buying TSLA for financials.,negative
The price of TSLA is too damn high,negative
"Tell TSLA shareholders to stop printing money on their ""undervalued"" stock.

No one fucking cares about overvalued in this clown market.  It's all about making money that's it.",negative
"I’ve never been more excited for a TSLA reversal and 1000$ lotto calls. MACD and RSI are icey cold on the daily and we had massive buying surge at the end of the day Friday. Up 15% already on the calls.

Oh papa Elon, take me to tendie mountain. 💰![img](emote|t5_2th52|6880)",negative
"It's not like you actually ""own"" anything with ANY stock.  But you sure as hell can make a lot of money with the right ones!  

NIO &gt; TSLA",negative
"Lol shitty group and Jp moron, that two banks w the lowest price targets on tsla. Analysts are ryan Stinkman and isgay (bear) michaeli",negative
Bro I bought too many TSLA calls,negative
"Im not gonna lie, you make some good points

Then you sound like nothing more than a shill for your short position when you say things like ""this wont be worth 25 in 10 years."" Who the fuck knows. 

Just two years ago, multiple analysts were calling Elon Musk a conman and that TSLA was worthless. Now those same analysts are the biggest TSLA bulls around. Stories change

At the end of the day, no one knows how this story goes. I'm certainly not going to listen to some loser who has nothing better to do than spend their time talking shit about a stock on the internet",negative

Work from the maths and let the maths be your guide to whether something is overvalued or not.

WRT TSLA, we're going to be seeing an annualised \~$10 EPS when Q4 earnings come in. That's growing at incredible rates with the current factories and won't slow down with Texas and Berlin opening very soon.

Give TSLA a PE of 100 and you are already at $1 trillion market cap on $10 EPS alone. And remember TSLA was priced at a PE of 1000 last year, so its PE has cut to 1/10th of what it was whilst the stock price has been growing.

"Firstly I suggest you go through my series on Mt.Gox. it's long and will get to part 11 and 12 when done with the holidays and some work. It will help you understand that I've a lot of problems in the crypto space and have detailed most of them with sources 

On the issue of ethics and moral stand points. I agree! One must have values and goals that they believe and more importantly act on

It is that last part that is important. Action! 

You don't need to engage with crypto by just buying it. You can short it, arbitrage it, interact with regulators, creators, institutions etc....

A person who is invested in ARK or TSLA  is interacting with crypto through their valuation 

The CME offers options 

There are family offices that you can contact today that are involved in a variety of secondary markets e.g mining and liquidity. Who have never even touched crypto 

Hell if you are in anyway involved in energy markets in Texas you have a very high chance of already being involved in crypto through mining

But most people who are anti-crypto do not have any exposure or interaction with the market. In a primary or secondary way. They just spew negatives with no proposed solutions. It's for lack of a better term a case of ""moral superiority"" 

E.g Rather than engage the issue of Texas proposed alliance with the Mining council on a financial or academic level. They just retort ""buttcoin bad"". Ok I understand you have concerns but here is the data. What is your proposed plan based on it; ""buttcoin bad"". Are you going to switch energy providers or invest in renewable energy? What is the miners bring jobs and use renewable energy to mine?

""Buttcoin bad"" 

Ok we get it; are you going to invest in the energy market? 

Are you going to vote or write viable non-authoritative legislation? 

""Buttcoin bad"" 

What about the banks that are giving the miners loans against their BTC. Are you going to interact with them? Are you aware of the on and off ramps of BTC mining? 

""Buttcoin bad"" 

Why are you even talking about this issue if you don't have money or personal stake in it? 

""Buttcoin bad"" 

This is what I'm talking about 

In action that boils down to this thing is bad and by not engaging with it on any level I prove my ""moral superiority"". I'm not actully doing anything or affecting anything but I feel better by pretending 

It's like this guy on climate change: https://youtu.be/3Ojxs6XKILM

"80$ in stocks is the most I have done, going to triple that tomorrow because why not. Smith and Wesson just dipped so maybe a little in that, a little in TSLA and then who knows.",negative
"Solar City.  Depending on how far down the TSLAQ rabbit hole you go, Elon bails out his cousin (Lyndon Rive, Solar City CEO) and other family members to save Solar City, while claiming it would provide TSLA with unique synergies.  They (TSLA) overpay for it despite it being on the verge of bk.  The real juicy bit is that SpaceX used $250m to buy Solar City bonds at one point.  Had Solar City gone bankrupt, Elon is likely toast at that point as using money that is at least indirectly connected to federal defense contracts to float some shitty solar company is going to attract some attention in DC.  Elon looks like a complete fucking moron in the depositions and his actual testimony on the stand.",negative

"Not that I suscribe to any storm but if you're bold, the US still has considerable negotiating power over the house of saud.

I'd look to go short oil and expect a rally on some crazy output deal (something which should have happened months ago but here we are).  Jerome, stays the course of his 50 BPS because the FED going to 75 reaks of panic and one thing they don't do is panic specially on an interest rate hike.

Finally MBS can't catch a bid but they are going to unload faster?  How's that work.  One thing most miss on this, is they can choose not to QT, they wont they promised a ramp to 90B per month.  So they'll stick with it.

I'm as bearish as it gets but I don't read the current events the same way you do.

TSLA to 350?  That 3:1 split going to fuck you because Elon said he had a shitty month and if there is one thing I know, the Muskrat is not stupid and pretty deft at market manipulation.",negative

How can people that are still buying TSLA stock have so stupid and still have enough money?,negative
"A TSLA style slow unwinding is still a version of MOASS just at a slower timeline. would still expect it to rise to MOASS levels given the idiosyncratic nature of the stock and the never seen before levels of shorting/naked shorting.

That said, my 'worst case scenario' is a slow MOASS, but i don't see that happening. Much more likely to be violent since they will just lose control at a certain point. TSLA didnt have as many never seen before variables as GME. ""You can't control everything Strange.""",negative
"Anti TSLA as in you're going to short it? 

I feel TSLA is wildly overvalued. A PE &gt;100 is insane. AMZN's PE is \~40, GOOG's PE is 20. Ford's PE is 9.

If I had sufficient capital (and guts) I'd short TSLA, but I don't know whether I can hold the short until the meme roller coaster stops.",negative

"You can roll the calls forward. You might still lose your shares one day, but you can still roll up and try to make more money.

&gt;they recognize 60% of it today and defer 40% of it. after FSD is no longer in limited beta they will recognize 100% of it.

So, from the head of TSLA PR, it is confirmed in black and white that they steal 60% upfront.

Now again, 

WHAT HAPPENS TO THE REMAINING 40% IF THE ORIGINAL CUSTOMER WHO PURCHASED FSD DIES, TOTALS THE CAR, SELLS THE CAR OR RETURNS THE LEASE, etc?

I'm going to assume this becomes a 100% vest and I'm going to need to know how that is legal, otherwise I'd like to know where all of these deferred 40% cash volumes are sitting at, where they are recorded and how they are recorded.",negative
"On my US side (80%) I’m all tech and on my Canadian side (20%) I’m all in ATZ thinking of selling some tech and buying TOU tomorrow. Tech consists of TSLA, SOXL and BULZ.

MSFT and TSLA will push the market higher,negative
"What do palantards see in their shitty stock!? B st case scenario it might pull a 30 yoy growth but then its getting diluted to the fucking oblivion by the insiders!

Dude Nvidia still has a 30% yoy growth in it, and it actually prints money up the ass

Sold Nvidia at $300 and $270",negative
almost everyone that isn't a TSLA fanboy hates them. Really reasonable conspiracy exists tying the creation of this sub to TSLA's meteoric rise. This place has always been a scam used to pump tickers and obfuscate sentiment/sources of FOMO/FUD but the fact remains it was still active/diverse in discussion/and knowledgeable back in the day. Now it's literally just idiots doing stupid shit and shills for pumps and dumps. TSLA is a scam but it's a scam that almost always goes up (until it inevitably doesnt of course).,negative
TLSA's valuation is intentionally inflated to make it a hated stock.  how many people shorting it is precisely what keeps it inflated. it's also a large weight in the S&amp;P so it can be used to prop up SPY. buying in spy leads to tsla buying and tsla buying itself inflates spy. a car company has no business with the valuation it has- it exists as a market tool and an ATM to withdraw funds from bears.,negative
"What's your time horizon? I'd go with one of AAPL, GOOG, TSLA or a bit in each (fractional).",negative
"You are so retarded. We are talking about TSLA with a 1T market cap today. 

That would be like saying AMD is worth more than NVDA and INTC combined. AMD was never this overvalued.",negative
I don't understand how TSLA has been able to sustain these price levels when every other inflated stock of the past 2 years has been absolutely fucked recently,negative
"TSLA giveth, and taketh away",negative
Didn’t sell TSLA call 1200 strike DTE 19 Nov for 100$ last week and now is worthless.,negative
TSLA doing TSLA things finally and going for ATH,negative
"If the market dumps on (good) MSFT earnings, then we're not looking for company earnings at all (tsla, aapl, v, etc). Those won't matter, good or bad.  It's JPow or bust now.",negative

"Everything except commodities (oil).

TSLA calls. Lands lords making money again first they are gonna go do buy a Tesla duh!,negative
If TSLA drops 20% I’m buying some fucking Tesla calls.,negative
"I invested in Tesla and took my 401k money and transferred it to an IRA that I could manage myself. So I took about 45k and it turned into a little over $100k, because TSLA has the stock split and then the bull run. That was last year. But I've learned you can flip money much faster if you're trading options. Along with buying Bitcoin and Ethereum I shot past $250k at the turn of the new year, and the plan is for $500k by the end of this year. Don't think anything with money is impossible. If you claim your goal before you set out for it...it will come to you as long as you work hard for it.",negative
TSLA is the real deal,negative

NYSE:ATH DATE : Wed Oct 13 20:21:48 2021 SUBREDDIT : stocks



[Yesterday's move felt like the kind of move that happens at the end of pullbacks, and it was accompanied by strong earnings reports as earning season started the past 2 days.  This is probably the point where you abandon puts and start buying dips (or keep buying dips if you already were), at least until we get closer to the November 2-3 Fed meeting.  Main reason yesterday's move was so bullish is that the market leaders approached or broke through new ATHs or closed their pullback gaps: GOOG, MSFT, CRM among big caps and of course UPST, AMBA, PANW and others among smaller caps.  TSLA showing tons of momentum the past couple days and basically just looks like it's set to challenge all time highs.  I'd expect some form of market rotation later in the year as we start getting to tapering (small co's look like they need to breakout at some point) and the tech stocks experience some kind of a mini-blowoff top, but for now market just looks set to get to all time highs especially with lots of stocks reacting well to earning beats so far.  Tons of money chasing momentum stocks makes it hard to believe we're still in pullback mode.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q8l7gz/daily_discussion_thread_for_october_15_2021/hgq4d5i/)

[Sorry man. Been in same situation as you. Take a break. This thing causes more stress and losses than the few lucky people that make it big.  This may seem simple but here is a way to prevent more losses. If you buy an option and it goes 20% into loss, close it completely. If you feel like taking risk, reverse the position. The ""cheap"" prices we get lured to for options are cheap for a reason. The massive dip is because everyone else wants out of that stock and we want to ""time"" the big play. It almost never works out. Instead, try buying a stock that is near ATH and take small profit in a week if it works out.

[BABA doesn't have a 5% dividend and would be a value play. VZ is a slow moving dinosaur that pays dividends. They're not the same.   VZ over the last 10 years has traded in a range of 40-60 (roughly) but pays a solid dividend that you will NOT get. Im not saying do or don't (I can't), but your investment will need to make some serious headway to justify the time, cost and missed divs for this play.   I couldn't really address your reason of ""the time will be worth more than the shares will.""

[They were cash positive in q4 with thousands of theaters worldwide still unable to open due to covid.  Many blockbusters got delayed due to covid and we've got this awkward period of no movies.  If streaming new release movies at home doesn't catch on during covid, it never will. Sure, I watched some at home, but only the ones I would've gave seen in theaters anyway. The movie studios are making more money having them only in theaters and then releasing them to DVD / streaming later.   Also, on the topic of streaming, the studios got greedy so it reinforces point one where they make more money releasing to theaters. Disney wanted your monthly fee for Disney+ AND $30. HBO had some new releases but not all of them so it was hit or miss. They also lost their deal for new releases January 1st of this year, and it's being broken off by some OTHER streaming service but still not carrying every movie.  A lot of actors also have points in their box office sales that don't translate well to streams. Studios are fucking everyone they can OR lose money paying actors on a per stream basis that doesn't generate them extra income like a movie ticket would - so the actors and studios are disincentivized.  Outside the streaming world, AMC has paid off several billion in debt early this year when the stock exploded, which saved them hundreds of millions in loan payments.  They also bought several of the most profitable theaters in California, New York City, and Canada when they closed down due to covid, so those will start turning profit when they re-open, if they haven't already.  The fundamentals were a meme, and are largely irrelevant to why most are in on the play, but even by fundamental standards it's undervalued right now. Looking at the chart of GME and AMC they're almost identical which is odd for two completely unrelated stocks. ETF's containing AMC are also being heavily shorted and we're seeing FUD articles left and right (much like this post) that suggest shorts still haven't covered - otherwise they'd ignore it altogether. We see continued hit pieces from Cramer, shill reddit accounts (like op's), stock market watch, or motley fool (that averaged almost 4 articles PER Day on AMC in 2021).](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sed51f/amc_holders_whyyy/huk4u1w/)

NYSE:TS DATE : Tue Feb  8 15:09:29 2022 SUBREDDIT : wallstreetbets



[TSMC has a limited capacity and it doesn't matter either. Some of the companies in the ecosystem are actually competitors of Intel.  Also, Amazon and Qualcomm are already customers of Intel's foundry services. Amazon will use Intel's packaging solution and Qualcomm will have Intel manufacture chips for them in 2024 (Intel 20A).  On top of that, the majority of what Intel is using will still be manufactured inhouse. At the same time Intel is also pushing forward with reduction of their own sizes and they also are the first ones to close a deal with ASML for their high NA EUV machines which will allow reducing transistor size in a massive way and will start producing with it in 2025.  And another thing, not all chips are required to be at the smallest possible size. For example current car chips are using a decade old tech, which is also why Intel is repurposing the fab in Ireland to produce car chips and encouraging car companies to advance to smaller size chips. Remotes, headsets, screens, keyboards, TVs, all of these are just a small portion of products that do not require 3nm chips, nor do they require 4 or 5nm chips. Heck, they could even use Intel's 10nm process or maybe even 14nm process while Intel goes to Intel 3 next year. Heck, the deal with Qualcomm for 2024 will be for chips smaller than the current TSMC 3nm.  TSMC also had tech issues with their 3nm process which is why they delayed production for Apple and Intel to the 2nd half of this year, while it was supposed to be the first half. If they had tech issues with the 3nm, they will likely have a lot of work to do to make it even smaller.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/snmc24/intc_ceo_patrick_gelsinger_claims_intel_can/hw4ssl3/)

Out of the stocks I'm watching at open there is usually one that i like the set up on the best and will be my main focus, but I can never be 100% sure on which stock is going to start moving with volume at open so I have multiple charts open that I'm watching at any given time.  Today I was watching FB, NVDA, BYND and SNAP into the open.

[Does anyone want to apologize to me yet? (https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qfp6rv/facebook_beats_eps_but_misses_revenue_user/hi10o16/)  That wider thread is also why I think there needs to be a change of pace from moderation re: earnings.  Clearly, that earnings call was mediocre for Facebook. Some might even say bad. Either way, not only were those statements downvoted (like why?) but there was actually zero discussion of the good things in the earnings call by pro-FB stans. It was just a big circle jerk because Facebook didn't plummet AH. The top comment is 'at least it's not SNAP.' It's clown statements by clown users  It's not limited to FB either  If our community can't or won't actually have meaningful discussions in earning call threads, and moderation can't or won't moderate the dumbest circle jerkers in there, then we shouldn't have earning call threads.

[I'd argue valuation always matters, but how people value something is the crux of the question. Valuation includes more than P/S or P/E and your level of investing sophistication and knowledge of the industry will dictate how you look at it. Even Cathy Woods tries to justify her Tesla claims on the basis of valuation.  Stock prices hit seemingly insane P/E and P/S levels when people start to assume growth potential is nearly unlimited. When reality inevitable sets in and a company hits speed bumps, then the stock prices crumbles accordingly, see SNAP recently.](/r/stocks/comments/qg7sgm/at_what_point_does_valuation_matter/hi4s7yl/)

NYSE:SNAP DATE : Mon Oct 25 21:43:12 2021 SUBREDDIT : stocks



[No, SNAP was not making excuses - FB took out a full ad in the NYT (I believe, or some other major newspaper) about how they didn't like Apple's changes and it would hurt small businesses (reading between the lines: they were worried it would hurt them)  FB was certainly hurt, after all they missed on many targets on this earnings and only beat EPS because of a buyback. Missed on basically everything else.   But people are somehow ignoring that SNAP is like a decent High School varsity football prospect who's hoping to walk-on to the College team, while FB  is like a 10-time pro bowl NFL legend.  They're both hurting but SNAP being hurt by Apple changes is not at all like FB being hurt by Apple changes.](/r/stocks/comments/qfp6rv/facebook_beats_eps_but_misses_revenue_user/hi2vwa8/)

NYSE:SNAP DATE : Tue Oct 26 05:09:45 2021 SUBREDDIT : stocks



[SNAP's miss was razor thin.  The reaction seems to be more driven by their guidance, which was fairly pessimistic.  It's possible SNAP is being overly conservative, but I can't tell yet if that's the case.  It does sound like FB also had a taste of the impact, and are worried.  But they're being more oblique about it than SNAP.  FB making wounded animal noises about how Apple is ""hurting small businesses"" and this weird distraction of ""metaverse"" just tells me that FB is actually worried.](/r/stocks/comments/qfp6rv/facebook_beats_eps_but_misses_revenue_user/hi1nuzb/)

Also /u/Cantgetfooledagain1 I havent seen people preach those companies much, but instead things like ZIM with a PE of fucking 2.

&amp;#x200B;

A developer or a software engineer with a sound mind has a hard time investing in most of tech (lets leave google, appl and msft behind). Do you have any idea how much bullshit goes on on this field? How much of it is pure fraud?

Is hard to invest in the long-term in companies that preach buzzwords that you very well know is bullshit. IA means statistical  analysis, cloud means someones else computer, big data in 99.9% of the cases means a big ass spreadsheet, N-F-Ts scam, block(hain and corn a unnecesary solution searching for a problem, metaverse second-life.

And when is not obvious fraud is something that causes alienation or some other type of negative externality. (See startlink and their ridiculous 50k sats on orbit)

That’s my whole thing with this. TSLA shareholders should be crazy concerned about this as they’re quite exposed if the market does take a shit. The share price is still way inflated and he’s gonna have to put up A LOT of shares to make this happen.

Later in the day I was checking my account to review my trades only to discover that I only closed 1 of my contracts the others ended up expiring worthless and a modest gain day quickly turned into my single worst trading day so far. I have been beating myself up over it, wondering how I could have overlooked such a large detail.

EDIT: I did not get a chance to reach my conclusions…

I am a relatively new trader: around 2 years. This was the first time I made a mistake with my order that resulted in a large loss. But seeing that I was not alone helped me realize that these mistakes happen. It helped me accept that human errors happen, and it’s best to keep your attention on the next trading day while taking steps to limit those errors in the future.",negative

"The strike is reduced by the ratio and the number of contracts is increased by the ratio (or the opposite for reverse-splits).

So if you have 3x $50 strike Calls on a stock that is going to split 2:1....then after the split, they will be 6x $25 strike Calls.

This is the ""normal"" way, but isn't always the case, usually deals with merges and reverse-splits, but there are cases where your option becomes ""untradeable"" and ""nonstandard."" For example, say you have 2x $50 strike Calls on a stock doing a 1:2 reverse split, they could decide to give you 2x $50 strike 50/100 Calls instead, which is a pain in the a\*\* because the atm and pricing are weird, and you can't trade them without broker authorization, you are set for ""close-only"" so you get the WORST value ever, or you can exercise, but you'll only get the partial.

You will have to read up on the split itself to see how they will handle the option chain.

Sidenote: Had you bought TSLA June2022 1800C in 15May of 2020 which would have been OTM by more than twice the price of the stock, it would have cost you about $9600 for just 1.

I was decently margined in 2018 when TSLA plummeted and Fidelity simultaneously raised the margin requirement.  I was not heavily margin, so I only had to pay a little bit, but it is very concerning that they can change the terms.

This is less of a factor, since Tesla is much more stable now and the investment firms are less likely to just change the margin requirements on you, and it will also not be much of a factor if you are well diversified.

Margin helped a lot, but it was very stressful watching my debt to asset ratio increase rapidly as TSLA dropped.

* Tesla sells more cars/year than Subaru's entire lineup, let alone EVs. By the end of this year Tesla will likely outsell the entire Subaru brand by 2x
* Tesla sells 2x more EVs in *one month* than Jaguar's all time cumulative iPace sales. Tesla's quarterly production is almost 2x Jaguar's annual sales.
* By the end of 2023 Tesla will be selling over 3M EVs/year.
* Tesla may surpass GM and Ford in earnings in 2022, certainly by 2023.

Note none of this means that Ford and GM and Toyota will be bankrupt or even disadvantaged in two - three years. However the idea that these manufacturers will be outproducing Tesla in EVs in two years is ludicrous.

[Here we go with the ""oh you go on the conspiracy Reddit so none of the verifiable shit you say has any merit, dur."" I get my news from credible journalists and I actually read the news that comes out instead of repeating provably false statements pushed by Jimmy Kimmel or wherever you ""get your news.""   -""your at home remedies don't work"" I'm not talking about fucking incense and acupuncture you dense fuck. It's like when you get any other sickness, there are things you are supposed to do before they get severe enough to cause hospitalization. If I get mono, I don't wait for my fucking spleen to rupture, I take antibiotics and medicine to help my body fight it off. There are several existing medications to help people through the early stages of this virus. They are never talked about in the media. They refuse to educate people on preliminary measures against this virus, literally things as basic as vitamin fucking D, and they do everything in their power to discredit working treatments being used all around the world right now. It's why you throw out bullshit like ""your local graveyard is full of people who tried."" There is literally no proof of what you're trying to say, and I'm guessing your talking about ivermectin because of the FAKE story about a hospital filled with ivermectin takers, which was a story that had to be RETRACTED because it had zero fucking truth or evidence to it.  -""they didn't create corona nor (have) any need to suppress info or medicine."" I guess we will ignore the gain of function research that likely caused this...but let's go to that second point, no need to suppress info or medicine. The drugs they are discrediting we're made cheap and readily available for people years ago, and nobody owns the rights to them so any company in the world can make them. They have discredited these remedies, and the us government has denied even the research that we need to determine how effective these drugs are, just so they can say ""this treatment is unproven to work."" They do this so that Pfizer and Merck can come out with their pre-hospital treatments that they are already announcing they will charge $1000 a pill for. But sure, profit is never a focus of big pharma above public health.   -""even if you were right and ""evil pharma and their crooked docs"" hid the cure they'd be unable to prevent every doctor and researcher world wide from finding out the truth."" You are exactly right! Which is why there are several highly credible doctors refuting the current measures being taken to treat covid in the US. But as soon as they speak to the American people, the media does everything in their power to discredit them and downplay their credentials. Just look at Dr. Peter McCullough, who is the most referenced doctor in medical journals who is still alive today. But he spoke on Joe Rogan, so he must be a doodoo head conspiracy theorist.   Here's ANOTHER problem with your reasoning. You speak as though the US and the FDA are the PEAK of medical science, and that their opinion is shared by all of the experts of the world. That is simply not true! Plenty of developed countries are handling this pandemic much better than us, and yes, using st home treatments so that their hospitals aren't overwhelmed. Even our own med schools and universities call into question the treatment the US has on this. The guy who created MRNA vaccine technology has said you can't vaccinate everyone and expect the problem to just go away. Everyone of your arguments are based off of assumption and hearsay. You are not paying attention to what is actually going on in the world and you're just repeating big media talking points that have no grounds in the reality of the current situation.

Those approvals were initially expected six months ago but despite delays they are still expected.   Omicron is looking mild. Vax stocks are losing their sex appeal/meme appeal, see the charts of MRNA and BNTX both down roughly 50% from their 2021 highs.

"Why I think MicroVision’s tech is likely going into Waymo because it can determine the speed of the objects It detects. Even Elon Musk has his 2 cents on it. Elon, it’s about time to invest in a set of Lidar that can detect speed! 😀

Some portions of the article that mentioned the importance of detecting speed.

&gt;**Elon Musk** says a lot of notable things, but in the self-driving sensor world, his most notorious claim is that “LIDAR is a crutch.” He declares that Tesla TSLA will never use it, because **he feels that solving self-driving requires computer vision that is so advanced that it can figure out distance and speed the way a human does, and that if you have that, you’re wasting your time and money with LIDAR.**

&gt;The **reporting of speed** turns out to be fairly important. One of the significant issues in self-driving today is the “sudden surprise obstacle.” The classic (and tragic) archetype of this is an emergency vehicle stopped in, or intruding into the left lane. You might be driving in that lane behind a van or other large vehicle, not able to see. Suddenly the driver of that van swerves to the right to avoid the stopped vehicle, and it is revealed to you. It is revealed with just a very short time for you to respond. It’s a challenge even for human drivers.

&gt;Any LIDAR is useful here, as it will never miss that the vehicle is there in front of you. However, at first, it doesn’t know that it’s stopped. You need to look at 2-3 “frames” of LIDAR or camera video to get good certainty that it’s stopped. Many LIDARs are run at only 10 to 15 frames per second, which means it can be 2 to 3 tenths of a second to figure that out, and you’ll travel 20-30 feet. Humans take even longer to react, but that’s no excuse.

&gt;This is why there is interest in getting the **speed** on any target. That way you can know instantly the obstacle is there, and that it’s not moving, and you have to brake or swerve now. It may be impossible to avoid a crash, but the sooner you start braking, the less severe it will be.",negative

"I've said this before - I don't hate Tesla the company. I think their quality is hit or miss, but whatever. I think Elon is a narcissistic shitdick manchild with way too many weird fluffers. The Tesla true believers, TSLA devotees, and other Musk adherents are who I hate. I've never encountered such an abrasive, unlikeable, condescending, incompetent group of people. They truly act like middle school and highschool bullies - arrogant over something they had no hand in. Like the kid in my middle school who was of Saudi money - had multiple $100 bills in his velcro wallet. Like the asshat in high school who drove a BMW M3 and wrecked it, so mommy and daddy bought him a new one.

His goals are 5 years out, not next month.

If TSLA goes to $2k tomorrow and stays there he is fucked - all the talent will retire as stock option multi-millionaires in the next 3-6 months and he'll have trouble hiring motivated+talented replacements (with 4 year stock option 'golden handcuffs' with a low strike price to make them want to stay 4+ years).

Based on his antics of the past 6 months - if the stock increases too much too fast he'll kill the momentum again and again.  I don't know how their employee-stock-purchase program is structured, but I suspect ~~is~~ if the market won't drop the stock from highs by 20+%, then Elon will, to get the employees a better price.",negative

Musk has either already filled his intentions to sell in which case he is using your ignorance as a cover or he will not be selling anything for six months.

If that happened, his options vega would spike up big time making the price of the contracts spike also.

This right here is called a volatility hedge and it is used very often by seasoned investors to hedge against a violent downturn in the market.

Options are not just about hitting the strike price, options were designed to be used as hedging mechanisms. The kinematics behind them is amazing.

&amp;#x200B;

That's not the point though, 2 months ago Lucid and Ford had essentially the exact same market cap even though Lucid has only sold 500 vehicles and Ford sells around 7 million EVERY YEAR.

&amp;#x200B;

They'd literally have to get absolutely everything right from this point on, and sell nearly 4 million cars a year just to justify their current valuation. And that's not including how far they'll be behind TSLA and even Ford with their AI driving.

&amp;#x200B;

TSLA sold like hot cakes because of its status symbol and the fact that it was unique for nearly a decade, nothing came close to it. Now literally every single car manufacturer is coming out with a EV car, there is absolutely no uniqueness in EV's anymore other than what they'll bring in the future and slight variances in range/performance/charging. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't see the demand for Lucids $100,000 cars to justify their valuation to be on par with Fords. If this car came out ten years ago that'd be a different story, but as a consumer there are just too many cars to choose from now. The car space is too crowded to justify these insane valuations, the only hope they have to keep up with these valuations is to absolutely kill the AI driving sector, which there is no way in hell they'd be able to do that on their own like how every other company is doing it",negative

It’s not like QQQ is total gambling either: if QQQ is 10% of your portfolio, then it’s more like you’re gambling the expected risk of QQQ vs VTI (maybe that comes out to be that more like 1% of your portfolio is playing a couple hands of blackjack)

Small cap value and emerging markets are probably compensated risks, if you want to be fancier than just VTI/VT

"I think passive investment makes sense for most investors because specifically of the simplicity, safety and cost effectiveness.  I myself have the core of my portfolio in a mix of broad market ETFs, then a couple ""side quest"" single name bets.

This being said... I am doing something different this year, in part, because of what you just said (and ironically... it was TSLA's entrance into the S&amp;P 500 that set me on this path).

The whole market is overvalued but to me TSLA stood out and I was pissed when it entered the S&amp;P 500 because I own a lot of VOO and now I own a lot of TSLA exposure too.  So this past winter I started experimenting with direct indexing the S&amp;P 500 (paper portfolio at first).  Took out TSLA... took out a couple long-held (and thus large cap gains) single name positions... and just ""paper invested"" in the rest.

Around May... I was adding money to my investments and instead of adding a portion to VOO... I converted my paper portfolio to a real one and implemented the direct index in a separate account.

I have a handful of companies that I've removed (again some for valuation reasons, some for ""I just have too much exposure already"" reasons) and its not even been a year.  So my divergence from the index is not meaningful (but I am technically beating it both because of what I chose, but also because I have no fees).  I started the direct index with $10k (so I've got \~498 of the \~505 names, all fractional).  I personally dig having the control and can see myself continue to tweak and express opinions from time to time.",negative

"u/kyith has written about WSML in detail before - check it out at [https://investmentmoats.com/passive-investing-2/msci-world-small-cap-etf-wsml/](https://investmentmoats.com/passive-investing-2/msci-world-small-cap-etf-wsml/)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I sometimes have this feeling I am diluting my IWDA when it can be 88/12 if I don’t include WSML.

I'd argue you are *concentrating* on IWDA if you do not include WSML. 78/11/11 (IWDA/EIMI/WSML) split is about the market cap weights of the total stock market currently. Doing this means you are at balance with the current market weights.

By including WSML, you theoretically get a better representative of current markets. But it's also true that the impact of Small Caps wouldn't rock a portfolio that much.

The reason VWRA is so often recommended lately especially to novice investors is because it's so simple. It's considerably easier to stick to one single fund, than to do say IWDA+EIMI+WSML in 78/11/11 proportions. There's less likelihood that they will start to question their conviction and tinker their portfolio unnecessarily, more often than not to their own detriment.

Doing just IWDA+EIMI, or VWRA, or ISAC are all solid strategies on their own. If anyone wants to include WSML in their portfolio, make sure you stick to the plan.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;EIMI seems to sort of gone sideways. Anyone contemplating just merely doing IWDA/Bond?

This sort of debate based on the most recent market conditions (recency bias) has been going on since time immemorial (I exaggerate, but it's been a long time since indexing was popularized).

Whether it is

1. Full US or US+International
2. Full stocks or stocks+bonds
3. Developed markets or DM+EM

It's always easy to look back and say US stocks has been absolutely crushing International, I should have went 100% US. EM has underperformed, I should have stuck with just DM. GME and TSLA went to the moon, if only I've bought in early.

The older folks over at Bogleheads.org will tell you they remember people asking around 2008-2012 (Global Financial Crisis) if stocks were too risky for the average investors. Nowadays, people are questioning the purpose of bonds in a portfolio due to the stock bull run since then. There's also so many debates about US vs International, to which I will simply point to [this](https://imgur.com/G9Eswzq).

Look at it another way. If EIMI has traded sideways, it means the market would price them lower - which is exactly when you should be getting more of them. Reversion to the mean is a real thing. Or will you drop EM altogether now and ask yourself the opposite question when it starts outperforming DM? Aren't you basically chasing performance - buying high, selling low?

In you truly believe in indexing, then you must believe you cannot get the winners without holding on to the losers. Once you've developed a sound investment strategy, [it's important to be almost blindly sticking to it](https://youtu.be/I8gH5bR3clg).

"While I agree with many of OP's overall points in various other comments they made over the past couple of weeks, I think basing any analysis on **GAAP** P/E's is fundamentally mistaken.

No buy side analyst looking into TSLA seriously does that. Literally none. The proper metric is cash flow and maybe EBIT if you are lazy.

GAAP income is so distorted that it's not even funny. It's distorted by:

- stock compensation expenses (which are in reality paid-in capital investments by employees),
- by Tesla's ***excessively*** conservative warranty reserves,
- by high interest expenses due to leveraged debt based hyper growth financing,
- by FSD referred revenue that is in reality 95% earned already,
- by unfavorable tax treatment accounting due to the assumption that Tesla won't ever make profits (!),
- (etc. etc.)

So I concur with keeping this removed until it's on more solid footing.

Don't want to discourage OP's excellent contributions though, and I'd be receptive to making an exception here if OP edits the post with a few clarifications that make the thesis less absolute/assertive. Even if I disagree with the GAAP angle. 😎",negative

I can buy US companies traded on EU exchanges through IB which is almost not possible in T212. The only such ticker I found on T212 is TL0 (TSLA). So it is very hard to avoid the currency conversion fee.

Also in my country (Bulgaria) I do not pay taxes if my gains are from stocks traded on exchanges in EU. Even my Bitcoin ETN is based in EU.

I can also change my base currency in IB if I would like.

Looking up analyst estimates the average is currently 12.3, with a high of 17. 12.3 would be a p/e of 51 for 2022, 17 would be a p/e of 37 at the current price of $628.

"[A lot of amateur traders seem to think that trading involves having a crystal ball and predicting exact prices with certainty.  Successful traders know that trading is a series of if/then statements.  You work algorithmically.  If price drops to X, buy looking for Y.  If price rises to Z, short looking for A.  You don't go full on conviction of ""I am sure price is going to go to B, therefore I will all in on this trade because I'm certain of it"".  That's how you get wrecked.  You can always pick a novice out by their attitude regarding these if/then predictions, because they're convinced there is only one right answer and you should be able to know what it is.

"Hmm.. isn’t that decay tempo depends on how far our strike price is from current price? I tested that when I wanted to sell really far OTM for decent premium, like 30-40 % (at IV 70%). Fastest decay that far OTM was surprisingly ci. 150-120 DTE, delta around 5. Anything less DTE so far OTM had lost already most of its value. So I guess decay pace at various DTE depends on your delta. Steep slope down strarts first for hell far OTM really early like 150 DTE+. The higher delta the later decay „golden DTE range”. Tastytrade classic 30-45 DTE works best with delta 30 or so, indeed there is like decay storm at that timeframe. But 30-45 DTE it’s pretty quiet for low deltas like 10, 5 (most of value gone) or lower but also for ATM delta 40-50 where hell opens closer to expiration. So all depends on your delta. You can see it looking at premiums for various delta at various DTE. IV also matters. My recent example: TSLA IV 70%, OTM delta 5, I found fastest decay with May’22, losing 50% within next 4 weeks. Later or sooner DTE did not make sense, as the decay pace was still/already slow. Bottomline: decay pace for various DTE depends on your delta.",negative

"I was talking to a friend who had been invested in Tesla and sold out completely a little while ago. And he's not convinced that it's time to get back in because he thinks there's too much risk from 'black swan' like events. Basically he's saying that for a company that takes an early lead in a new market, and can potentially see really big growth for a few years, a rare/unexpected event can really throw things off and it would hurt the leader much more than all the other competitors. For example, what if a new battery technology comes out that's amazing for stationary storage, and all of a sudden Tesla's storage business takes a big hit? Or what if some government(s) decide they need to pro-actively bail out their auto industry and/or accelerate EV manufacturing and pass really aggressive incentives/subsidies/etc. for local companies only?

It all seems somewhat unlikely to me, but his point is that it's really hard to predict these rare events, especially in a rapidly changing market.

But then he made another really interesting point, that it's really hard to get good information/research on any bearish thesis for Tesla because the TSLAQ crowd is just constantly spewing so much bad information. If there are any good bear ideas out there, they're completely swamped and ignored by the this huge population that just hates anything Musk does and/or hates Tesla specifically for leading in EVs and amplifies all the pointless noise. Like a recall that's actually just a software update so the passenger can't play solitaire, something that's completely meaningless and has no impact on the fundamentals or risks, but dominates the TSLA news for a couple days, even on investing outlets.

It's basically a [false positive paradox/base rate fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy). There are big important trends that are moving the market, and they're widely ignored in favor of giving way too much importance to individual events that may or may not matter. On balance all these little events probably barely matter at all, but they're given so much attention that it's impossible to spot a real potential problem among all the bad information.",negative

[Damn right up until that last paragraph I was really empathetic and concerned. Then when I saw that you bet the house on AMC, and not even a sensible meme stock like GME… Jesus wept. First of all its not free money, its money you pay back with a fee, and any stocks purchased on margin can be lent out by your broker in order to short the stock. So you actively hurt your stock by buying it on margin and not direct registering. Secondly AMC is a failing business, thats not FUD, look at it objectively, they have nothing of substance going for them unlike GME. Yes shorted meme stocks might pop, but its a good idea to invest in a stock with not laughable fundamentals, that are riding trends and not cashing in on gimmicks, insiders who buy stock instead of dumping it, dont lie about their partnerships and talk a big game without putting their money where their mouth is. Amc has always been a distraction meme stock, face up with your failed bet, work your ass off to pull yourself out of this absurdly idiotic hole you dug yourself in. You now have to prove your actions may have been stupid but that doesnt mean you have to commit to being stupid. I really hope this is a joke and you didnt get fooled by Wish.com GME](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uoxsux/has_anyone_here_been_margin_called_im_worried/i8hqmwr/)

"I'll give an example specifically for this past Friday.  When TSLA was 1034, I bought 4 1020p and 4 1040c for roughly 300 each. When TSLA hit 1022, I sold two puts for 875 each and bought 4 more 1040c for 125 each (averaging down your position). I kept two puts to hedge myself in case TSLA didn't hold that 1020 support. If it had fallen through the floor, those two puts would have covered my losses on the call side. When TSLA hit 1040 the first time, I sold 4 calls. I had 4 calls and two puts left, which I let all run until close. The puts expired worthless and the calls autosold at 1050.  The main reason I let them run, was because A) I was playing with house money at that point, and B) I knew power hour would move one way or another in a decent size. So it was a sress free trade.  

What you're thinking of is a strangle, which is still good, but R/R is going to be higher because you're buying at strike essentially. I was able to buy cheap because I sent $10 OTM on either side.  So essentially, my only loss were the two puts that expired worthless ($600 total) and total gain was $10,372. Total risk was $2,650",negative

"I don't know much about Tesla other business.  so I will take a stab at the automotive side.  The problem is the 12 million by 2027.  Not saying they can't but I am unsure they can sell 12 million vehicles with this type of margins we saw in q4 2021.  The world is still poor.  There is a limited amount of people that can afford these cars.  Tesla cars are in the luxury priced range (I mean a sports sedan that cost $45 to $50K isn't exactly a $30K Honda Accord).  by 2027 the estimated sales of luxury vehicles will be about $655 billion (https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/10/22/2318987/0/en/Global-Luxury-Car-Market-Report-2020-2027-to-Hit-USD-655-0-Billion-at-a-CAGR-of-9-3.html).   I estimate about $55K/vehicle...this will be about $655 billion/$55K = 11.9 million vehicle.  If tesla were to sell 12 million vehicles they would have to go be able to produce lower priced car as to compete with the camry, corolla, rav-4/cr-v, hilux, etc....The lower price car won't have the same amount of profits (may have same margins but lower profits...ie. 30% margins on $50K is $15K , whereas 30% margins on $30K is only $9K).  Unless Tesla can get 100% of all luxury price car, then I don't think they get the same amount of profits.  this is not to say their other stuff can't make money: ie. solar, batteries, autonomy, tequila, flame thrower, karoeke microphone,  etc.... As of now, they are still a vast majority automotive company.  anyways: $7 trillion market cap is more than 3x of current automotive market cap.  There is a limited amount of profits in this world.  It is not endless. Car building is very capital intensive. Vast majority of tesla cars are sold in countries with big incentives.  I suppose rich countries have endless supplies of incentives; but at some point, I think it will end.   €9K in Germany, €6K in France, No VAT in Norway.  Tesla will be able to still sell without incentive; but I do believe without incentive they won't be selling as much.  I do not have any TSLA: just whatever is in VTI and QQQ.  I am neither bearish nor bullish.  I will take whatever the market gives me.",negative

Bear cases:

Bond yields dropping after having risen, this is the most reliable indicator signaling significant moves in the stock market. Bond prices rising. Inflation running hot. The s&amp;p500s and s&amp;p100s value is mostly derived from 8 companies. Some of which are extremely overvalued. China's market has been struggling for the last year. Most mid cap stocks have already dropped 50% in value. The fed is turning hawkish, rate hikes are already known by the elite (and also the general public by now) Corona still has to impact the market (March 2020 was pure panic). Supply lines are weak. Russian economy has gone down the shitter. OIL price has spiked same thing happend in 1986, 2000 AND 2008.

"Flow guru Scott Rubner at Goldman Sachs reminds us of the shift in flows. The message is basically there are no more inflows.  
  
1. The average entry point on a record \~$1.4 Trillion worth of inflows is $4,163 in S&amp;P 500 terms.  
  
2. For every $100 deployed into the stock market over 74 weeks only $2 have been redeemed thus far.  
  
3. Passive funds saw 100% of the inflows over this period. USA funds saw 75% of inflows ($1.05 Trillion) vs. ROW saw 25% of inflows ($350 Billion)  
  
4. watch the generals - ""When you redeem $1 from QQQ, you are selling 13 cents in AAPL, 11 cents in MSFT, 8 cents in GOOG/L, 6 cents in AMZN, 4 cents in TSLA. 42 cents of every $1 sold from 5 stocks""  
  
5. Rubner writes he has never seen this type of selling...people are redeeming, i.e asking for money...which translates into selling of the big names (seen Apple lately?).  
  
Add to the above the current short gamma and shitty liquidity and things will continue to be very frustrating for most.

[&gt; I've been cautioned to avoid picking individual stocks as I have no idea. Would you agree that picking individual stocks is dicey?  Dicey if you don't know why you are buying a stock or don't have help. There are online stock pickers who sell stock recommendations to subscribers. I don't buy everything they recommend but my market-beating individual stocks came from such subscriptions.  Since you have an account at Schwab one thing you could do to see if individual stocks are for you with a very small investment is to take advantage of Schwab's Stock Slices program https://www.schwab.com/fractional-shares-stock-slices  You can buy fractional (&lt;1 share) shares of stocks for as little as $5 each. For as little as $100 you could own fractional shares of 20 different companies. If you can afford to dedicate $100 in your account to individual stocks, try putting $5 into each of the following companies with Schwab Stock Slices and then see how that portfolio of stocks does compared to your S&amp;P 500 index ETF after 1 year:  MRNA FTNT F NVDA IT ANET IRM TSLA ETSY AMD ZBRA NOW ODFL AAPL MSFT POOL NFLX IDXX GOOGL COST  You could also add companies that your are familiar with like Amazon (AMZN), Starbucks (SBUX), or Domino's Pizza (DPZ) for $5 each.  The S&amp;P 500 had an above-average year last year, it seems unlikely it would have back-to-back above-average years.

"You already alluded to the fact that you don’t know what you’re talking about since you’re completely unaware of the fact that TSLA underwent a short squeeze due to stock dividend. 

This also means you have no clue the situation surrounding TSLA during 2020. They were the OG hodlers and apes. They started the “meme” stock movement before the term was even coined. 

The arrogance is claiming you have any proof that there is one way to launch MOASS while having zero clue about previous similar situations. 

I will admit they are different, the big difference is that there is a massively higher short interest, meaning this will be a quicker and way more violent squeeze.",negative
TSLA broke wedge on 5+15,negative
Oooof TSLA crashing at pre-pre market.,negative
"PTON is 0.02% of ARKW and not in any other ARKs, I’m sure TSLA this week has offset her PTON loss and more",negative
"Eh, I cant argue too much. Lots of merit to what you say. 

It IS deflationary. The only key problems, to me, are energy concerns and bad actors. A single tweet from certain people can wipe 20% of value in a few hours. That is unnatural, risky, and would never happen with adopted currency. Imagine if Musk made the US dollar drop in value to 50cents because he said TSLA would only take bitcoin? 


I like crypto and it's prospects. I don't like the scummy influencers using it to fill their pockets and turning the losers (majority) away. Not so much the case with bitcoin, but look at any other crap alt-coin backed by every celebrity in the world early 2021",negative

"So gotta shift my only other holding; 2000 PLTR this week and moving it into TSLA. Timing, timing, timing. I am all about that deep dicking discount.  


It may be a mistake but I am thinking mid to end of the week will be the moment. Let's see if I am wrong or not and let's hope Elon finally gets this over with this week.",negative

TSLA is way undervalued vs RIVN. Just watch...,negative
Or it could be that $TSLA is at $1200 post split,negative
"I like trading AAPL or MSFT.  The worst AAPL will do to you is go against you $2- if you even let it get that far.    TSLA gives me heartburn, you could lose the price of a Tesla in 2 minutes- trading TSLA",negative
"Elon needs to quit with all this electric car, rocket and satellite bullshit and focus on sex robots, just after the announcement alone TSLA would instantly be first $2 trillion company",negative

nobody has been paying any attention to the fact that China has become the most important part of TSLA business and China is on record as saying that part of the TSLA deal includes the provision that TSLA can't take any of those profits out of the country. You think BABA, JD look bad after China crack down - wait until people wake up to what lies ahead for TSLA.",negative

"Well hello all! 

I’ve been on this subreddit since I was a mere child when I was abandoned here by r/all. Lost and afraid, all I could do was buy calls. So I did.

$AAPL 180c 12/28
$DIS 160c 12/28
$NVDA 300c 12/28

"OP keeps calling people childish and ridiculous while in no way arguing back. I don't think that is part of a good faith discussion.

EDIT: not sure if OP blocked me like anyone else too who dares to disagree... Anyway, In my opinion Musks character is very relevant to investments that rely on his actions a lot. You (OP) seem to be dismissing all of the comments about that as ridicilous, childish etc. and often atttacking the people who disagree with you while in no way engagin in dialogue  about the actual subject. You keep hiding behind saying it politics while this is an international forum where many don't care about which US party they would wote for or whatever their opinion is of of any politician. Musk has a history of making actions that dont seem to make much sence such as Boring company, getting in trouble with SEC or Tesla board for saying stuff he should not or for buying out Twitter. By saying Musk is not a rational actor people mean that you can't expect Musk to act here in his (financial) self interest but he could act based on some ulterior motive or by his ego instead of what would make the most financial sense. This has been seen many times already and it is something one needs to consider when investing in his endeavours. I am putting my money where my mouth is and personally I have been shorting TSLA for a bit less than a year now because I have been believing on a recession and recession of Elon Musks mental health. Neither the economy or Elon Musk seemed to be on a stable foundation. And yes I have formed my opinions from something else than Twitter too. I have watched technical interviews with him too but I have a technical background so I know how to see some realities too with stuff like ""self driving in year n+1"" where n is the current year.",negative
