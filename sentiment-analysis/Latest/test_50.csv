"OP that 2021 scenario is highly skewed

First, TSLA was coming off of SPX inclusion and rallied from $300 a share to about $700 before going parabolic in Jan to $900 range

at the time, VIX was around 35 handle AND tesla IV was through the roof

So the 2022 leaps were overpriced because of high IV AND ALSO high VIX. 

My buddy did this, he banked $250k selling something like $1500c

however, when tesla was at $1100, he tried to do it again, but the IV has diminished a lot and VIX was in the gutter, so there was a lot less premium to be made",positive
"I suppose you could technically think of it that way, although most of the time it wouldn't be very productive. Overlap often exists but it's not often significant. In nearly all cases a person is 99% one or the other, so it makes the most sense to look at how one makes one's living. If someone makes a living by working with capital they do not own -- if they work for someone else's business, in other words -- then it makes sense to classify that person as *proletariat* even if they own a share or two of TSLA or GME or whatever (or ten shares, or a hundred, or a thousand). From the standpoint of the individual, that person has the mindset of a proletarian -- they work a day job because they need to, and therefore they likely understand the fear of losing that job, and of thus losing their healthcare, and home, and perhaps even their life as a consequence of the whims of another. That person likely understands the feeling of being valued only for the financial worth that they produce rather than for their worth as a human being. And from the standpoint of the society they inhabit, that person is valuable despite not being treated as such, because their labor is part of what keeps that society afloat -- even if, in many cases, their labor is of little material worth in the uniquely sick society that we have today.

On the other hand, if someone makes a living by owning the capital with which others work -- if they own a business, in other words, or own enough parts of them that they can make a living by trading stock -- then it makes sense to classify that person as a *capitalist* regardless of the fact that they were once forced to laboriously place a single paper in a trash can when their secretary was out sick once in 1995. From the standpoint of the individual, that person has the mindset of a capitalist -- they own a business and in a very real sense they own the time and labor of their employees. They have power, and power, as they say, corrupts. For the most part capitalists do not work because they do not need to; their employees produce enough value to pay for themselves while keeping the business afloat and the capitalist can live comfortably by skimming off the top. And from the standpoint of the society they inhabit the capitalist is valued despite being, in a very material sense, not only unnecessary but in many cases utterly destructive to the health of that society. Capitalists are valued because society exists to serve capital. Unlike the proletariat, when a capitalist calls the police the police actually show up.

There is a grey area in which that distinction actually matters, though -- and although it is small, it is significant enough to warrant its own classification: *petty bourgeoisie*. That generally includes small business owners, although since you asked about stocks I suppose people who make a meaningful amount of money via e.g. day trading while requiring a wage, salary, or contract job to supplement their income would also fit into that category. On an individual level this group is generally characterized by an entrepreneurial spirit and often by the belief that hard work alone was responsible for their success. To their credit it is indeed often the case that they have worked hard and many small business owners, having not forgotten their roots, labor alongside their employees. But often this view verges into the belief that hard work is the only necessary criterion for success, which is objectively false under capitalism and easily leads to contempt for the less fortunate (i.e. a Boomer mindset). On a societal level this group often consists of pillars of the community because the petty bourgeoisie, unlike the big bourgeoisie, benefit from a strong local community. However, this class is an unstable one; the petty bourgeoisie are constantly in danger of being put out of business by the big bourgeoisie. The petty bourgeoisie has therefore historically been the ally of the proletariat because they share a common enemy and the common goal of a society that actually functions, although that alliance does tend to waver.",positive

1. I noticed the price volume distribution, however this is not what I am looking for. I'd like the ability to overlay the Volume Indicator into the chart, not the volume distribution. (I also think this would help with #3, as it would require the chart to zoom out some in order to fit the volume in the chart)
2. As mentioned, being able to save trendlines to a particular stock AND carry over from chart to chart would be a great option. E.g. Trendline on 180day chart for TSLA carry over to my 10day or 1day chart. 
3. I do see the grey adjustment arrows and have played with it, but you are limited in movement here. I just want it to zoom out from standard a bit, a wider view so to speak.
4. I will send in some screenshots, i'm still having this issue. 
5. I understand how the ATP zoom feature works, it's just not ideal. I would like to see an incremental zoom by just clicking the + or - and still allow for the dragging of the cursor if you want a particular time range. ATP's zoom feature is all or nothing, once you zoom in to a time range, if you click -, it goes all the way back out.
6. This was a user error on my end, I was saving it incorrectly. 
7. I get how to use the action menu next to the ticker in the watchlist, but I would like the watchlist itself to have a ""link"" option so it uses the current chart and news feed I have in my layout. I do not want it to open new windows/charts/news feeds. 

These are just my opinions and features that i'd like to see added/upgraded.",positive

[Sure but there's examples of very long term failures to reach new highs, coupled with periods of high inflation in between, soooo even when it reached the old highs, it didn't buy you as much..  Notable examples:  1929 to 1954 - no new highs, high inflation in the 40s during WW2 especially and after due to shortages  1968 to 1982 - no new highs, market kinda went side ways but with several 40 - 50% drops, during the late 70s especially stocks were considered dead money - high inflation period so when stocks eventually took out the 1968 high they were no where close to the actual 1968 buying power, that was likely not achieved until the mid-late 80s. Also, interest rates were so high in the 70s and early 80s normal folks like most of us became forced sellers to fund our lives and definitely weren't buying stocks in 1980 when it was finally almost over seeing as bonds were yielding 14 - 20%... Also the 80s rally which really started the secular bull market which is now ending was highly manipulated thanks to Reagan tax cuts America could not afford which led to the now untenable debt levels and why the Fed will try to fight inflation but either fail or, absolutely destroy America's economy if they're successful because the government can't afford 7 - 10%+ interest rates without massive tax increases on everyone, and budget cuts too, and government spending makes up for like 20% of usa economy or something so them cutting spending whilst also taking more from workers will be a double whammy.   Nasdaq 2000 to 2015 - 80-90% drop, many companies went totally bankrupt, a few winners in the long run which everyone here pretends they'd probably have been invested in and held for 20 years like Amazon and gotten super rich off but more than likely Nortel woulda been the beloved stock on here over the Amazon book store... Also a fair bit of inflation in those 15 years but not terrible.. But house prices certainly went up and also many people lost everything in 2008 - 2011 so even if they did hold their Nasdaq stocks like Amazon til then, they were likely sellers in 2008 near the lows in order to keep their homes.  So ya, sure, stocks always seem to reach new highs but a lot of that is financial engineering, ignoring the fact that inflation exists especially a lot in things normal people need to buy like energy, food, housing and sone companies outright fail if you have any ""speculative growth stocks"" you hold, well they're the most likely failures... (it is why they're all down 75% whilst overall market is currently down just 20% and I say ""just"" because 20% isn't much of a drop especially considering the abysmal economy and geopolitical situation and famine on the way and the great resignation happening.. It's going way lower eventually.. There will be big bounces along the way, 20%+, all designed to kerp y'all invested and suck in more suckers, whilst all it is is shorts covering making real money and then re-entering their shorts at the top of each rally whilst ppl on here will be most convinced that we've reached a permanent low and go all in, months or years before the real final low.   And this time the Fed doesn't have investors backs, unlike the last 13 year (could really go back 30+ years...) fake as hell bull market with rates at 0% for 13 years and REAL RATES currently at negative 8%... But I'm sure this is all just good and normal and sustainable and literally everyone will be rich soon! (because I don't know anyone who isn't tossing ridiculous sums of money into the market expecting to be super rich really soon so they can quit their jobs en masse and just be traders rest of their lives, doesn't sound like a massive unsustainable bubble at all!)](/r/stocks/comments/uvcwuc/im_selling_everything_rstocks_may_2022/i9omitu/)

"To OP, I don't think anyone doubts the future of EV's.  However, in term of investing, people have been buying into EV stocks for years and at some point, valuation will come into play.  

To keep it short, you have to choose the ones that will win.  My guess is that many of the recent EV SPAC's won't be around in a few years.  TSLA is obviously a leader, but it is very expensive and more so if you factored out the emission credits it sold every quarter.  It is a cult stock and valuation doesn't really matter at this point, but it may eventually become a factor.  And when it does, it'd better make a lot more profits to justify the stock valuation.

I'd stay away from any Chinese stocks with all the political uncertainties at this point.

NASDAQ:FB / 8

[I have substantial holdings in AAPL, which I'm mentioning to show that I have proverbial skin in the game.   My concern that AAPL will not maintain its current valuation/stock price is twofold. First, eroding consumer discretionary income will likely lead to longer upgrade cycles, which means eroding revenue. It's also questionable how hard inflation will affect them, as there is a limit to what an average consumer will pay for a phone upgrade (especially now that their phones are nearing, and exceeding, the $1k mark) in the context of ever-smaller improvements in performance and functionality.   Second, this market has shown that it will punish companies that don't absolutely blow out expectations. FB is a great example of this.

[Serious question, why are you asking Reddit this? If you're looking at current adjusted P/E ratios and have them on a historical graph, you should be able to see for yourself and come to your own opinion as to whether it's in a bubble or not. (and if you did this, you'd see the PE ratios are fine, so... what's the point of the question?)  For reference in the dotcom bubble Nasdaq's P/E went above 200. it's at like 27 today.  Leading up to the 2008 crash SPY's P/E hit 120. it's at like 25 now.   Before 2008 my dad sold all his stocks because he thought this was crazy, it can't keep going. A lot of his friends called him crazy and kept buying, some on margin, and got absolutely destroyed.   Don't use reddit, buffet, your friends, or least of all the permabear michael fkn burry as your guideline lol. Dude came close to losing it all shorting in 2008 and lost his shirt shorting Tesla with the rest of the hedge funds. He just got lucky being long FB at the same time as his tesla short.   These guys aren't gods. If indexes are overvalued like you're worried about then it wouldn't be hard at all to find out for yourself.

"Yes.

I scalp-traded TSLA yesterday too.

Here are [**some screenshots for your reference**](https://imgur.com/a/ghbnFyp) as far as how much those options contracts were moving. **Look at the timestamps** of when I took the screenshots on my phone. **Look at the current price of the options contract (on the right)**. I believe at one point it was around 55.00+ which means easy 4k+ profit off a $1,485 contract (in my trading case) for instance.

I intentionally blurred the number of contracts I traded that morning because I've learned it's best to keep (my own) trading to myself after I've made some posts recently. Some people are simply unappreciative or jealous of someone else's success. I guess it's just ""human nature"". Work on your own trading and keep it all to yourself is my new advice.

By publicly sharing my own screenshots I just wanted to show you that what your friend said to you was easily possible scalping those TSLA call options.

Keep in mind that these types of trades do not happen every day, but TSLA is definitely fun to trade right now to say the least. Part of one's trading edge is to understand when to jump in heavy or light on a position to capitalize on such immense move/opportunity.

"[FB wasn't crushed solely because of the metaverse, or their investment in it. They were crushed because average daily users plummeted, their ad revenue was down, and they are facing stiff competition from TikTok, SNAP, and others. They also aren't able to gather as much data about users due to the new iOS restrictions, and it isn't unlikely that Android may follow suit at some point. Because of the competition FB faces, I think it is causing investors to remember the social media platforms that once had a monopoly that FB dethroned. These platforms come and go in cycles. FB has alienated a lot of its users due to censorship, fact-checking, and the overall big brother feel with the constant COVID messaging anytime someone mentions COVID in their post. I personally don't appreciate the ""Take this survey about how you're feeling"" message that appears from FB at the top of my feed nearly every time I sign in even though I have dismissed it. My health is none of FB's business.   NVDA is much more than self-driving and metaverse. They are also considered to be at the cutting edge of supercomputer development, self-driving and AI are a part of that. They are also the most common chip used for Crypto mining computers, which play an integral role in server farms (including cloud). I would suggest looking into NVDA further to get the explanation you are looking for. TSLA and NVDA trade at high forward P/E like most other tech companies.   Since you mentioned TSLA, they are more than a car company. They also have an insurance and finance arm, and they are using tech developed for the cars and translating that to other future uses. There is also an unquantifiable gain to be had once self-driving and their robotaxi program goes online. I don't think self-driving is as far away as you think.](/r/stocks/comments/so26m6/fb_officially_worth_less_than_nvda/hw7wqf4/)

KEYWORD : NVDA DATE : Wed Feb  9 04:06:08 2022 SUBREDDIT : stocks



[NVDA is way overvalued, especially when compared to its competitors. For instance, AMD competes with NVDA in that it makes GPUs, and simultaneously competes with INTC in that they create processors.  INTC has an edge in that, a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would completely crumble the semiconductor industry, and the US government has been weary of being reliant on Taiwan in recent stimulus bills. More and more funding will be given to INTC to have a domestic solution over the upcoming years.  Semiconductors are very important for the future, but it is still unclear if the stocks are cyclical in their nature.   In terms of FB being worth less than NVDA, I strongly disagree with you, especially when looking at the financials. FB has nearly 2B *daily users*. FB has *consistently* grown over the years; they nearly 3x'd their revenue from 2016 to 2020 alone. Once Oculus *breaks even* (key idea is that we are not speaking about profit, just breaking even), FB will increase their free-cash-flow by $10B annually. Furthermore, FB is sitting on piles upon piles of cash, which means they can acquire practically whatever they need.](/r/stocks/comments/so26m6/fb_officially_worth_less_than_nvda/hw6v1x1/)

Just look at DAU numbers.  If any new Apps that are better than FaceBook or Instagram start attracting masses of smartphone users, they can literally wipe Meta out within a matter of few years. TikTok shows how fragile customer preferences are when it comes to Apps. Instagram is fighting tooth and nails with its reels to counter TikTok.  They even changed their name to a Product and Service that is not even going to give them anything in return for at least a decade and they are going to throw money at this bottomless pit called ‚ÄúMetaverse‚Äù as they mentioned on their last earnings call.

Also, NVDAs addressable market in the business data center is estimated at $100 billion as the shift from CPUs to GPUs in data centers increases. Data center sales alone in Q4 were up 90%!

[They may be ahead in the race, but it doesn't matter that much when there's still such a long way to go.  The only thing that matters is how big of a breakthrough can the company get to push it past that goal.  A company that has a 100B cap is 9.9T to go, and Apple has 7T to go.  That's a 30% headstart on the race while being 70 times bigger as an entity.  So yeah, I think it's going to be what the next gen's tech is.  I doubt Apple has enough in it to continue making leaps in stock price from technological breakthroughs.  I personally vote for NVDA if AI eventually comes to fruition, TSLA if all shortage and tech problems get solved, FB if the metaverse really takes off for some amazing reason., or some next-gen tech that is not yet founded.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sn6eo4/what_do_you_think_will_be_the_first_10_trillion/hw22miz/)
