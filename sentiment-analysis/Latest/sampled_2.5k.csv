"[Hey, look.

Right now we would have been months away from it opening.

What do you think Canada is doing up there? Just mining tar sands and stockpiling that oil? No, they are shipping it south to U.S. refineries, we are already getting their oil, the pipeline just changes who gets paid to cart it to the refinery.

Good job slapping yourself on the back to thinking you go outside your box to ‚Äúview‚Äù the other side.   Straight up I do read left and right outlets, and this entire XL pipeline has been political theater. Supposedly from a post on WSB aprox 2017, it started as rivalry from rail and pipeline. So political donations went out to ensure the oil stayed being transported by rail, and political donations went out to get pipelines built. Their oil isn‚Äôt that good anyways, in 10 years we won‚Äôt need it.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tt39kz/president_joe_biden_to_order_the_release_of_up_to/i2y3w5o/)

[Check your info again, buddy.  * You can't just convert ICE to EV factories. The manufacturing process is completely different. Whereas you need thousands of parts for an ICE, an EV requires fewer parts. Many assembly lines are thus, useless. And since you can't stop your current ICE production, there is no easy way to transition into EV production in that same factory which is why these automakers are building new factories. * ICE and EV are two completely different products. EV's is a loss-leader right now. GM has been losing money on their Chevy Bolt. Ford will lose money on their lightning truck and Mach-E. So comparing the amount of sales with ICE and EV is pointless. This is like comparing flip phone sales to smart phones during the early stages. Flip phones did vastly more units sold. Does that mean flip phones are a stronger business model? * Ford's profit margin is NOT 32%. It's not anywhere close to 1/3rd of that. IDK what numbers you are looking at. Show me any data representing as such. GM's profit margin is higher than Ford, btw. Where are you getting your data from? You're claiming Ford earned $45 billion in profit last year? Show me. * Ford Lightning doesn't have 200,000 paid orders... they have 200,000 pre-orders. It cost $100 to preorder it of which only acts as a deposit. Cybertruck has over 1.4 million pre-orders... * $17 billion cash for a company that just started mass production three years ago is insane. * LUCID doesn't have better technology, neither does NIO. You are just rambling nonsense. Name the better technological advantages they have.  You don't understand the industry. Stop making numbers and data up.

"sure

step 1. Buy a call (""long call"") with a decent amount of time on it, ideally 6-12 months, but you can do it with 2-3 or less if desired. TSLA is expensive to get far out expirations for most people.  For this example let's say you bought a TSLA 6/17 call at $1100 strike. 
 
step 2: go to the stock's main view in robinhood, click ""view all options"". change the top left slider to SELL and make sure the top right slider says CALL (""short call""). Choose an EARLIER date than the ""long call"". Now choose a EQUAL or HIGHER strike than the long call. For this example you could choose a 4/8 $1200 or a 4/14 $1175 or a 4/22 $1250 or whatever you want, as long as it is equal or before expiration of the long call and an equal or higher strike. 

step 3. click on the option you want to sell, click ""continue"", set your limit price, then complete the transaction.

You will then have sold the short call and receive the premium you entered in (once the order fills). 



**there's no requirement for the long call to have a certain amount of time on it. The short call just needs to be at an equal or sooner expiration. Also, you can do the same for puts. Technically speaking these are called ""diagonal spreads"" if the strikes are different or ""calendar spreads"" if they are the same, but often you'll see these called ""poor man's covered call""",positive

"[No problem. Easiest way to think about the cloud is just someone elses computer.  So some background to help frame the idea.  Basically how the internet works, this is simplified, when you open up your browser and type in url, your modem has a phone book to get the correct address.  Every request normally goes to a server and the server is responsible for responding to request. It's kind of like a phone operator. A server itself, it just a computer. Usually they are built not to have graphical components, but they can.  The next layer to understand is databases. Databases are used to store information.  So when you log into reddit for an example, your browser makes the call to the server, the sever will return back all the information.  Now with dealing with servers, there is a scaling issues. Like when you hear about DDoS attacks, it's sending a ton of requests to the server and the server can't keep it. It's like the operator got too busy and it fails.  Now where the cloud comes in is that you need a server to live somewhere. Companies usually store on premise. On-prem is the keyword you might here. The other option is using the cloud. So when you use like AWS or Azure, you are basically just using their computers as your servers.  One of nice aspects of this is that you can use a CDN, like NET, to have multiple locations. Going back to the request part, every request have to go to a server. If your company is located on the east coast and someone from the west coast asks for your site,  it will take them a little longer, since the requests have to go from the west coast to the east coast and back. It sounds crazy, but with mobile sites, people usually bounce after like 2 seconds, so any time you can save is key.  I hope that helps, let me know if you have anymore questions or anything ins't that clear.](/r/stocks/comments/rfcse9/rstocks_daily_discussion_monday_dec_13_2021/hof3y6g/)

Most federal filing will be free, so then it‚Äôs finding the cheapest state filing. The Free File Alliance is a IRS recognized group of companies who do individual filings for free and discounted additional services. However, unless you paper filed last year, the company you used last year will be able to easily submit an amended return. You‚Äôll most likely pay a penalty but it‚Äôs worth getting done and over with now rather than waiting. Tax dodging is a low grade felony and the IRS will get their money üòÖ You could also appeal the penalty when you get the letter.

NYSE:ATR / 10

[You've now seen the typical trader mindset.  Most daytraders I have met are downright nasty individuals that love to shit on others and kick them when they are down.  I am not sure what the fascination of acting holier than thou is with traders in general.  There's not some closely guarded secret.  Price can do 3 things, go up, down, or stay flat.  There's only 5 things you can learn on a chart, open, close, high, low, and volume.  Yet people act like they are protecting the damn holy grail when they find something that makes them profitable 51% of the time.  If price action doesn't click with you, don't force it.  Indicators lag, sure, but they take all of the data from x periods ago and smooth it into a reliable, repeatable signal.  My biggest gripe about price action (and I have a group I am in and kinda-sorted founded that is all price action trading) is that you have to watch your screen all damn day.  They also are a nervous bunch.  They post their charts (and maybe they just aren't good at it) but it has 10-15 entries before they get it right and they are stopping out for a couple pennies a bunch.  I don't have time for that and I don't want to do that.  With an indicator, I can set an alert and I am done to notify me when to pay attention, I use another indicator, the ATR, to tell me where a likely safe stop loss is, and I jump in.  It takes me all of 2 minutes and I can do other stuff while I wait.  In short, if you are struggling with price action and don't understand it, look to a couple of indicators that will work in conjunction to smooth out the random noise on the chart to give you somewhat reliable signals.  Anyone who makes fun of you for doing this is a dumbass and ultimately why I really despise talking about strategies with others, as they will *always* find a flaw in your strat, no matter what.  At the end of the day your job as a trader is to have an equity curve that grows from the low left to the top right.  It doesn't matter how you get there, what tools you used, or how long it takes.  I've seen on other trading subs someone literally post that they did this one fairly simplistic thing, with defined entries and exits, good risk management and are now living off their trading success and a bunch of people pile in claim they are lying and that they are seconds away from blowing up their account on a bad trade.

Another trick, beware this on TradingView, is showing a strategy that has an unreasonable win rate and risk/reward, like 45% at 4r with a profit factor to match. In general, they're using some minute measurement like 0.1 ATR for a stop and 0.4 ATR for the take profit level (or more nuts, like 0.05 ATR and 0.2 ATR), allowing them to take advantage of TradingView's lack of tick data to skew results in their favor.](/r/Daytrading/comments/sfxfld/stupid_trading_tricks/husw6vg/)

[So the stocks on this list are stocks you wanna add new? Or ones that you already own? Cost Basis matters of course. Personally, I think META is a very good buy at the current valuation. You can rarely go wrong with MSFT, GOOG and AAPL, although I don't quite like their valuation yet. Don't like NIO, although the potential upside obviously rises the lower it goes. Be mindful that it's not expected to be profitable for years, and that the risk of being a chinese stock remain.  Don't like TSLA at all at the current valuation. If it drops 50% it could be interesting, though. Personally I do like DIS, although one should be mindful of the risk. Don't like ABNB at all at the current valuation. INTC could be interesting although I'm looking for it to drop another 10% at least. KO, MCD, T are obviously mature, stable businesses. They can bring stability but I'm not too sure about them actually helping you deliver the returns you're probably looking for.](/r/stocks/comments/v2cjwj/rate_my_portfolio_rstocks_quarterly_thread_june/ic2iveq/)

"[The Big Dilemma With Lump-Sum Investing  The biggest question most investors have when they need to invest a lump sum is whether they should buy stocks all at once or stretch out investing over time. There's no right or wrong answer, and there are pros and cons to each approach.  If you put all your money into the market immediately, you ensure that you'll quickly get invested in the promising companies you choose. Given that the stock market's long-term returns are far better than the near-zero returns you'll get on cash, it makes sense to invest quickly rather than waiting.  However, investing all your money at once comes with a downside. If your timing turns out to be bad, then you might put all your money into the market right before a correction or bear market. That shouldn't matter, because your time horizon runs for years or even decades. But it's nevertheless a tough thing to endure emotionally to see your portfolio lose money out of the gate.  Because of that, some people prefer to break up lump sums into several chunks. For instance, they might invest a third of their money now, with plans to invest the second piece one or two months into the future and the final chunk a month or two after that. That means you're sitting on cash, and if your stocks go up, you'll wish you'd gotten all your money working faster. But if a crash happens, you'll have a chance to buy some shares at the lower price.  We're not market timers. But if one strategy sounds better to you than the other, then go with that. It's important to feel confident when you're first investing a big lump sum.  From Motley Fool.    From my personal experience, I am 39 years old, no debt, can invest $800 to $1000 monthly. My portfolio consisted of the following, 20% VTI, 40% into the ""Tech-Semi equipm, Scientific, AR, VR, Haptic, Optic, Communication, etc"" category (these you will seldomly see reddit mentioned, as they are ultra-aggressive, micro, small, or mid cap stocks):  SYNA, AMBA, LSCC, PXLW, KEYS, NPTN, FN, ACLS, ZUO, SMTC, POWI, ENTG, COHR, AZTA, AVNW, NTNX, KLIC, ARLO, UCTT, SMAR, CIDM, LITE, MKSI, CGHX, COHU, VIAV, HIMX, AEIS, PING,  ACMR, IIVI, $S0L0, KOPN, GNSS, IMMR, MVIS, VUZI, EMAN, CETX, INTT, ALGN, SIMO, MODN, EXLS, AYX, SLP, INTT, YEXT, LAC, EXPO, CNMD, NEWR, FIVN, CLNE  15% into individual stocks that I think will rise in near future, namely: CDNS, SNPS, TER, NVCR, ANSS, CPNG, OZON, WK, KRNT, ZTS, AXON, NET, CRWD, UPST, GOOG, TMUS, DOCN, INTU, DCT, CWH, SNOW, etc. And ETFs, ARKK, TAN, LIT, PHO, FAN, SMH, GAMR, MOON, KOMP.  5% into USA (a closed-end fund that gives about 10% annual dividend)  5% into crytpo, LTC  10% as IRAs and HSA into ARKK and KOMP  My Investment fund is fully invested into them.  Volatility of the 40% slice (the ultra-aggressive ones) is 2 to 5% differentials whenever market bloom or correct in a day or 2.  It doesn't outrun VTI yet, but I have seen that part of my portfolio runs 15% unrealiazed gain compare to VTI's 26%. I am aiming for a 500% to 1000% with that part of my portfolio within 5 years, but that's just my take of it.  So in case you don't have any idea what to invest, you can definitely research on these, even as individual stocks, there are 80 or more in this comment, so there are so much you can diversified into.](/r/stocks/comments/rq0gzq/is_it_too_late_for_the_stock_market/hqfejfz/)

[""Please consider putting the majority of your money into broad market index funds.""  I really am surprised at how unaware folks are of how much data is AGAINST active management which is defined as:  security selection (picking stocks) and market timing based on whatever valuations you want to use.  It is SO unlikely folks are going to outperform the index yet so many folks are so willing to put their future retirement on the line for it despite only getting one chance at it.  The overconfidence of the average investor is just down right scary.  My advice:  Carve out 5-10% AT MOST for active management and put the rest into passive index funds with no guessing if the market is over or undervalued.  Trust me you are not a genius and will thank yourself for accepting that upfront.

"TSLA can be expected to hold up relatively well, because Tesla is GAAP profitable, maintains a high growth rate, and generates monster cash flow. 

Palantir generates healthy cash flow, but it is not GAAP profitable, and it hasn't yet hit a parabolic takeoff in business growth.  

I think that Palantir can reach GAAP profitability and a growth rate much higher than most people expect, but it's impossible to know for sure whether this will happen, and when.  The current macro environment means that PLTR valuation will likely continue to be low.  I've been slowly buying PLTR shares here and there.

Rarely do stocks end up at zero value, not saying it isn't possible (it of course is), but most investors whether in equities, real estate, crypto or ?  work with probabilities rather than possibilities.   The probability of say AAPL, GOOGL, TSLA, or NVDA dropping to zero is certainly possible, but not very probable.

It is like going to Vegas and playing roulette.  If you bet  $1,000 on Black or Red you have a better than 47% probability of winning.  If you bet on Black 35 you have only about a 2.5 % probability of winning.  And like you say, in both cases an argument could be made (correctly) that you can lose it all.  It is just that one is much more likely to happen than the other.

You point about hardware is spot on.  When I was mining with 26 GPUs back in 2017 (all 1080ti) I sold them all in June 2018 and made about 65-75% of my hardware costs back, not to mention a chit load of ZEC that I traded for BTC",positive

[That is a bit heavy into ABNB for me, but if your analysis leads you to feeling that confident I say send it. The other 75% is a wonderful portfolio in my opinion. Would you consider breaking that 25% in ABNB into 5% and you can find 4 other companies to make a combined 25% portfolio of companies you like? Sorry if this is incoherent, I hit the reefer too hard ya see.  Edit to say I misread your 25% LMT as 25% LIT 50% in 2 stocks, especially those 2 stocks seems very risky. If you would like to do 50% stock choices I would still recommend breaking them up into 3 minimum 5-7 ideal 8-10 okay amount of companies that you have decided have a solid future in 3 decades.

NASDAQ:NVDA / 52

[Set up a good Risk Reward rule. For example I get stopped out of a trade at 1R (I use 50$ as an R) and winning trades I aim for 2-3R (ofc there are trades that go beyond that) but the point of that is I could have one winning trades for 3R (150) and then two losers (-100) and still be profitable. That‚Äôs being right only 1/3 of the time. Again though the goal isn‚Äôt to be wrong but setting something like this up will help a LOT I‚Äôm in the same boat I fell ill crazy medical condition so I NEED to continue to perfect my trades cuz I need a steady income too   As soon as I started to study I put in about 300+ hours of books, YouTube, and courses (still learning to this day ofc) I‚Äôm also in a group of experienced traders that help point things out as well it‚Äôs a great help. IDK how much you know but Candlestick Patterns are KEY, RSI super important, (MACD is also a good one) other indicators are great too but you don‚Äôt wanna clutter your screen. I use for Moving averages for DAY TRADING 5ma, 9ma, 21ma. For 5min time frames I watch for the 5 to cross over the 9 (no I don‚Äôt just wait for that I have a whole plan/thing going with RSI too) oh and also it‚Äôs great to start off by watching 5-10 stocks EVERYDAY you wanna know how they move my first few were MSFT, JPM, AAPL, SPY, DIS. I‚Äôve recently added FB, BA and NVDA tryna get good at TSLA too. But think about it if you‚Äôre good with one stock, you know how it moves you watch big times frames, the news, etc then it‚Äôll be easier for you to make money off that one stock. The goal is multiple stocks and to be able to trade anything but start small. The first few I listed have very cheap weekly options that are GREAT for day trading. On fridays if you trade something that expires that day you wanna be in and out in minutes because by the end of the day if the option isn‚Äôt ITM it‚Äôs priced to Zero so the last couple hours of fridays def beware. I ain‚Äôt gonna keep going I hope this helped any questions message me if you‚Äôre iffy on candlesticks lmk I have a fantastic book that teaches most simple yet most powerful patterns](/r/Daytrading/comments/pi01d0/question_for_those_who_made_it_what_is_a/hbpmdlj/)

[Think NVDA will be fine in the short/medium term.  Why I continue to have a material position long.  But I do worry longer term.  I believe the future is more and more the big guys making their own chips.  Google for example is doing their own in the Pixel 6 and will also start to offer Chromebooks with their own chips starting in 2023.  Amazon is starting to do their own chips for their cloud.   Tesla is doing their own client AI chips in the cars.  But still using Nvidia for the back-end.  I do not see this trend ending.    Because the industry has completely changed.   There was a time that Intel made the chips and Dell purchased and put in their servers and sold to an end company.   There was literally 10s of millions of companies buying the servers.  Today it is more and more the servers come from Google, Amazon or Microsoft with their clouds.  It completely changes the calculus of the chip business.   Take the power needed to run the servers.  That was just not high on the list of features when the 10s of millions of companies were buying the servers.  But today with Google having literally millions and millions of servers it makes a huge difference to lower the power footprint.  There was a time I was responsible for buying servers and I do not remember even considering the power footprint when we purchased.  We did the generation before with the mainframes because they needed special power and we had to make sure it was available.  It is the reason Google created the TPUs.  They could not afford to run the hardware available at the time.   It is also a big reason that Google designed all their own network processors.  https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/02/09/google_processor/  ""Building an AI Chip Saved Google From Building a Dozen New Data Centers Google has detailed its TPU---and the tremendous savings that came with it.""  https://www.wired.com/2017/04/building-ai-chip-saved-google-building-dozen-new-data-centers/  The companies today have resources unlike companies of the past.   But they then also have the ROI with their massive infrastructure to justify designing and building their own chips.  To me the place that is going to kill it is companies like TSMC that have the Fabs.  I do NOT think the Google's of the world are going to do their own FABs.  But I guess that could happen down the road.  It is interesting to watch because I am really old and we are returning more and more to how things use to be.  It is also why I own more GOOG than I do NVDA.  GOOG is just a lot safer for the long term.](/r/stocks/comments/pjfiv7/nvda_what_happens_when_mining_slows/hbws6gx/)

[This is my opinion as I'm in my fourth year of University for IT so do what you like with this response (since I'm probably only using very basic aspects of these mentioned software and nothing super advanced) but the main strengths that I find Google Docs beats Word is the collaboration and the ease of integration with Google Drive.  If I want to take notes in class, I can sign into my Google account, open Google Docs on a school computer (if I have a class in a computer lab, which is very common for my field) and and write my lecture notes without the minor inconveniences of worrying about forgetting to save my .docx file to a flash drive. This also gives me the added benefit of always having access to my previous assignments / lecture notes for reference.  The collaboration as you mentioned as a plus is definitely the one thing that makes Google Suite stand out the most for me as I always use it for group lecture notes, group assignments, labs, reports, projects, etc. I haven't really tried MSFT's web-app for Word, but I have found the performance for me to be a bit clunky to turn me off using the web-app suite completely.  The only time I'm really avoiding using Google Suite is when I can't work on my desktop and need to work on my laptop. The web-app for Google Suite is just too resource intensive (ironic since Chromebooks exist) for my 2015 laptop running Linux Mint.  I do know that if Microsoft is able to incorporate seamless collaboration through their Office suite software, they would stand to put up a pretty good fight against the hold Google has been putting on the education market as of late.](/r/stocks/comments/v5rxlx/google_is_a_better_long_term_hold_than_microsoft/ibcrrw7/)

[I guess to ask the question another way, what's the value of a company with declining YoY revenue growth? Even if it's trading at a really great valuation would you buy it? If a company / sector is in secular decline how would you expect the stock to perform long-term?  This is what I've been warning people about when investing in something like FB. It might be undervalued today, but if the market is pricing in the fact that the company's revenue growth is going to slow and eventually decline, and it's right in that prediction, then it could easily be a value trap a few years down the line.  I think the main advantage of buying companies that are operating in growing sectors of the economy and that have strong top line growth is that you're not likely to buy a value trap. Even if the price is a bit high eventually the stock can grow into the valuation, but even if you brought a GPRO or a BB at an objectively great price several years ago you still got screwed if you held it long-term. But if you brought a MSFT at the absolute peak of the dotcom bubble you'd still be fine in the end, because you correctly identified a company and sector with long-term growth potential.](/r/stocks/comments/tnd140/revenue_growth_for_a_sector_or_company_does_not/i259otn/)

[Shoutout to KRBN.  Outside of KRBN, I don't understand your thesis.  &gt;I'll also occasionally add to $QYLD to increase my dividend income and because I believe the NASDAQ will trade sideways.  But 75% of your portfolio are NDX100 constituents in fairly close weightings to your own. QQQ holds AAPL, TSLA, MSFT, GOOG &amp; GOOGL, FB, and NVDA.  Why actively manage a portfolio you believe will trade sideways?  Also, why QYLD over an actively managed income fund? I don't like the mechanical nature of the fund where it will sell ATM calls no matter what. It's always going to trail the NDX in bull or bear markets because it offers almost no downside protection at all while capping all the upside (ask anybody who does buy-write and they'll tell you that it doesn't help in a correction very much).  If you insist on an income fund, pick an actual income fund! Find something uncorrelated to market returns so that your income won't be reliant on equity. Or at least get a better income fund that has an ear to the market, tries to manage tax considerations, and has a better track record like $ETV.

So, why isn't Gamestop overvalued?

Below you can see how $GME's P/S multiple isn't that outrageous when looking at some specialty retailing peers.

When looking at some sectors that GME is moving into, the P/S multiples get outrageous. I'm not gonna break them down because this thread is already too long, but every valid Web 3.0 play I can find trades over 10x sales, expect for $FB at 8.33x.

 How TF did they end up with a 0.04x sales multiple?

Newegg is a e-commerce website that focused on PC components and recently pushing into complementary segments, such as gaming. Probably the most apples-to-apples comparison to Gamestop right now.

$NEGG trades at 3.17x sales with 14% gross margins. $GME trades at 1.93x sales with 25% gross margins.

Okay, lets talk about Opensea for a minute. 

Here's their GMV over the last few months.

 ¬∑ Dec 9, 2021
Over the past year, OpenSea has done about $1 billion in revenue. 

At a 2.5% take-rate, that's ~ $40 billion in GMV. 

So over the past 12 months, nearly all NFT volume was roughly the same as Shopify's GMV during the past 3 months ($41.8 billion)

Currently at 200,000 MAUs, Opensea is valued at $10B. 

50K per user.

Remember, Gamestop has a customer base of 55 million, or 16.6% of the US. 

Gamestop has the opportunity to drive NFT participation rates.

I personally believe GME's financials (company in whole obv) are at an inflection point.

Revenue

Wait FCF was positive in FY2021?

Gross Income accelerating

Same with pre-tax profit

I'm not saying Gamestop is incredibly undervalued. 

I'm saying that $GME's valuation isn't as outrageous as some may think, and by no metric is the company in trouble.

I chose not to model $GME due to unknown revenue lines. 

Here's a link to a great valuation breakdown from

Costing hedge funds over $6bn in losses over the past six months, GameStop is not an ordinary stock, nor is it a failing brick-and-mortar retail chain like Wall Street previously thought. It is...

It can easily grow into higher valuations, much higher imo.

Now, what if all the theories of Citadel never closing their shorts are true?

Well great, you will own an asset that hedge funds will have to pay an arm and leg for. 

However, that's not the only thesis behind Gamestop, which is what's being portrayed by the media.

I've done some digging into some of the theories regarding the naked shorting, and quite honestly I can't tell if they're true. 

But I also could not say they're debunked. Some of the activity regarding this stock has been incredibly odd.

Apes, this one's for you. 

Just in-case they're true, I've DRSed my shares to support the movement.

The price could easily have a massive pullback, but many companies that have built cult like followings have sustained ""outrageously high valuations"" until they hit an exponential growth curve. 

Look at $TSLA.

I expect Gamestop to grow their underlying business exponentially, and we'll likely see the same story as Tesla. 

""It's a Brick and Mortar store, why is it worth $40B?""

I can't believe I made it all the way through this thread and didn't even mention E-Sports. 

While they aren't strongly positioned there yet, they're a perfect company to take part in that space that's also growing at a 15% CAGR.

f they did build a gaming metaverse, there would be plenty of different ways to implement and benefit from e-sports through that.

Basically, Gamestop is a startup with $1.4B in cash in a rapidly growing space, supply chain infrastructure, proven executers from top companies globally, and 55 million customers.

Shifting to a technology first company, growing the underlying business dramciatally, tied in with multiple expansion is a powerful force.

I would not be short this stock.

[ARK seems to be trading way too often and is falling victim to ‚Äúthe market is irrational short-term‚Äù. They won‚Äôt win by chasing daily, weekly or even monthly gains.   She‚Äôs right in a sense that at least some of her picks have solid fundamentals, excellent growth and probably a bright future, whether the fed rate is at 0% or 1% or 4%. TDOC is trading well below book value at this point and it seems to be a case of the market over-correcting. Hopefully she doesn‚Äôt dump TDOC in the 70s, that would be a shame for her clients.   I think that with more money being in the market than ever before, thanks to apps like Robinhood and WeBull making it so easy for Average Joe to buy in, we will see more extreme ‚Äúbubbles‚Äù, so speculative stocks like SPCE and TDOC and TWTR that have been a Cathie-favorite will see more volatility in both directions because of all these ‚Äúretail‚Äù amateur investors doing what randos on SeekingAlpha tell them to do. You have to remember the average joe is pretty gullible. Like tell them to buy a penny stock trading at 0.03 because ‚Äúit‚Äôll moon any day now‚Äù and they‚Äôll do it.   Ergo the expression ‚Äúmarkets are irrational short-term and rational long-term‚Äù applies now more than ever. The 1% will happily scoop up these stocks at a discount and leave Average Joe retail investors with solidified losses.   I suspect it‚Äôs mainly an issue of the poorer people in this country investing more than they can afford to lose and panic selling before they lose even more of their mattress money, not understanding that the market moves in two directions. The weaker your hands, the more $ you lose.   All signs point to this being a blip correction and anyone who holds will likely be very green as a result by this time next year. Maybe not, but at least they didn‚Äôt pussy out and realize the loss. Like does the company have decent fundamentals? Then fucking hold.

Why work highly stressful 80h-100h weeks at Tesla when you can work 30-40h weeks in a FAANG, make 2x-3x the money you would at Tesla, and then invest that money into TSLA?

For some people, the work is worth it. Others ask: why?

I'd happily work 1.5x more hours for Tesla if they paid me what I currently make. But the last time I spoke to them, they wanted me potentially working weekends (they were so upfront about this!) and floated half of what I currently make.

Edit: Also, the thing about joining a grindy organization like Tesla is that, well, maybe initially you want that grind and ""company vision"".

[No, wrong. Please don‚Äôt show ignorance in order to try to win an argument. You‚Äôre assuming the other 29 companies of the DOW remain unchanged. Your whole premise that the DOW‚Äôs rise to ATH as Facebook plunged means nothing is faulted and every profitable trader will tell you so. EVERY good trader I know uses a particular stocks relative strength against what ever index they‚Äôre tracking as a gauge to enter a trade. For instance, if the DOW is sluggish, not going anywhere but JPM is rising and continues to rise when the DOW dips, that is a good sign to trade JPM. If this concept is beyond your grasp, then you need to learn about relative strength.

[Buy this week/not buy the next week is not the same as buy this week/no longer good if you bought last week. This is precisely because time in the market functions by allowing underlying fundamentals to grow and continue to push the total value higher.   Example:   I built a JPM position over two installments, almost 3 months ago. My basis is $149.36/share. It currently lists as overvalued by trading at $171.78 vs a (Fidelity) listed valuation of $166.31. The ‚Äúovervalued‚Äù label doesn‚Äôt make it a bad hold. It makes it a bad buy for short term traders, at current price. For me, it‚Äôs a great hold. The position is up 15% (not counting div yield), and the business will continue to grow revenue and increase estimations of fair value while I hold. Over time, it will again be described as ‚Äúunder value‚Äù, at a price above current fair value. Given long enough, it will be ‚Äúunder valued‚Äù at 2x, 3x, etc.   This is the mechanism of time in the market.](/r/stocks/comments/qej6gb/where_does_time_in_the_market_apply/hhurhek/)

"[While I am bullish on PLTR, I can list a few downsides: its valuation is already pretty high at 46.03B (though if it becomes a hundred billion dollar company down the line, I suppose that won't matter that much).   Another downside is the negative connotation PLTR gets from being lumped in with the WSB meme stocks.  Another risk is that even though consumer growth for the company was reported as being on the rise in the last earnings report, the numbers, in terms of definitive customer growth, are still somewhat ambiguous.   When PLTR is able to establish that they have not only huge governmental contracts and customers in tow, I think it'll be a much safer bet.   That being said, with their strong leadership, potentially epochal and game-changing technology and lack of definitive competitors, I think they'll be able to achieve both the former and the latter and we'll see the stock price finally move as a result.

[Hey guys, pretty nice trade on TSLA today. It was a pretty choppy day in the market all day, didn't take any trades in the morning. I noticed TSLA was nearing the HOD and began to watch it. I knew if it could break the $789 level and knowing HOD was above the potential was there, I was worrisome though because of how weak SPY &amp; QQQ began to look. As I took my entry some news came out and a sudden surge of volume moved the stock up. Got in right as it began to move for only one contract.  Sold as it began to pullback for $330 profit.  I was light on buying power (holding some longer exp calls for msft) so I had to go pretty OTM for the second trade. $800 key level, huge size on the ask and it was holding up well. It made a high of $805, my contract was worth $2.80 at the peak but when they are so far OTM the values go down quick on any pullbacks. Still managed to get $30 out of the trade and call it day for $360 profit.  Really been trying to be patient and wait setups, this can also show people that you don't need massive accounts to trade stocks like TSLA and make money. Granted not everyday TSLA makes a move like this but 1 contract went up 100% in nearly 5 minutes. I have been sticking to trading blue chips with wide ranges and really waiting for my setups.  Overall great day!](/r/Daytrading/comments/q3kc9c/tsla_107_trade_recap_367/hfsata5/)

However, we are all expecting the 21Q4 results to be pretty special (even if they're not gunning as hard for last-minute deliveries as previous quarters), as well as the impending start of production at both Berlin and Austin, *plus* additional construction going on at Shanghai.

[Just started myself. So far, I am sticking to LEAPs. These are in-the-money call options on stocks I think will go up but with expiration dates a year or more out. Some reasons for this choice are that a far out expiration means I can potentially ride out any dips in the stock price, if I actually hold the option for the full year I will pay a much lower tax rate on the gain, and it‚Äôs the same concept as buying and holding the stock you believe in except with less capital. While your money is still much more at-risk as as opposed to just buying the stock, you mitigate a lot of that risk being in-the-money at purchase and having a far out expiration date. I just started this week, with LEAPs on AAPL, PLTR, and GLBE. Made some money already but will most likely hold these for a while.](/r/stocks/comments/tsj6gu/trading_options/i2tk8md/)

[A free/consumer app that accounts for dollar cost averaging/individual stock picking vs an ETF like SPY.   What I mean is, as I accumulate shares, I would like to know if I instead didn‚Äôt buy individual shares, and bought only SPY on that particular date at the spot price of SPY, if I wouldn‚Äôt better or worse off. And also to account for sales of stock as well. So essentially a way to backrest whether just buying and holding SPY would be better than individual stock picking as I keep adding investment money sporadically throughout the years.   I also do this with an excel formula- I just export out my basis and use an excel stock formula to get the spot price of SPY at a given date but would be nice if this was in app form.   I use TD and the problem with their graphs is that it only looks at portfolio value vs the market. So if I dump money into the account, it looks like I‚Äôm outperforming the market when in reality my account balance is going up because of additional capital contributions and not because the underlying investments are going up.

This could lead to them not stopping out. They would just let trade go in the other direction for way to too long.  2. Greed - Assume he's right and only really smart people can win with trading. So why did they fail? The answer is likely greed. They weren't taking profits, OR they were following a plan like 3 to 1. And over time, they let profit dwindle away.  3.

TSLA relies far too much on Elon Musk's quasi personnality cult for my taste. He has been a successful trailblazer in some ways, but he's also got a track record of making many pie-in-the-sky promises and predictions that fall completely flat. As a CEO he's somewhat erratic, and I could see him crashing and burning, taking the company and stock down with him.   Not only that but TSLA's products are far more complex and difficult to deliver, there are just a lot more ways that projects can be delayed and fall apart.](/r/stocks/comments/q5kk1r/if_you_had_to_choose_one_stock_between_tsla_and/hg6ekv9/)

"[&gt;MSFT  MSFT is still up \~1500% since start of 01 lol I'm sure it smashed most of the companies that ""stayed in"" for that comparison if you compared 1 to 1. In fact if you look at an Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc they have all been massive wealth generators over the last number of decades and look stronger than ever in many respects. I am not so sure Apple is today's GE or IBM. Big lessons were learned from poorly run previous giants, particularly in high tech. Some mega caps of today have a very strong opportunity to literally 'own' and/or control (essentially) the entire financial, healthcare, transportation, entertainment, and automation infrastructure inside the next decade. I agree that probably every Rome will have it's day if the time interval is stretched enough, but it isn't some sure bet or rule to follow in our current modern society. The next generation (or paradigm) in computing will be AR/VR, beyond that potentially neurally interlaced computing, etc... I'm 27 and will hopefully live to see both transpire; yet what are my chances or building the next Apple to overtake them in one of these paradigms and smash them in market share there, etc... it's almost 0 for anyone. Compare this to Apple, MSFT, etc doing the same thing to IBM back in the 80s/90s it was totally different... IBM was run by morons who were totally non forward thinking. Same for GE, same for legacy autos getting shit on now by Tesla. Similar to how  you won't catch Tesla snoozing on being ultra forward thinking on all avenues of automation and their entire design approach being fundamentally geared at solving very generalized automation problems.... Mega caps of today like Apple and likely MSFT have learned  a lot from seeing how they literally vaporized IBM (MSFT fell into a similar trap due to awful management and missed computing shift to mobile (ie pocket computers, and tablets) but they may have recovered quite nicely with Azure and pushing hard to be on the more enterprise hardware/software side of things). We know (from public patents, leaks, and job postings and public hirings) Apple is aggressively infiltrating payments (soon to be crypto exchange as well), health records and consumer health data tracking, storage and encryption (just the beginning), transportation (consumer car efforts seem likely, if not geofenced robotaxi rollout), along with entertainment (Apple TV productions and platform), while also shifting to the most significant next computing paradigm (AR/VR). I'm beyond bullish Apple (obviously lol) but I think many of these tech companies now are far too forward thinking and aggressive toward all new markets they can infiltrate effectively and they have far more resources in many cases than those before them.](/r/stocks/comments/rcpzl6/without_its_top_5_stocks_nasdaq_is_down_25_ytd/ho83pe7/)

The wide spread of ICE vehicles has been heralded by accelerated valuation of oil companies. How much capacity modern electric grids have to allow for wide use of electric vehicles? How much money provinces, cities and towns invest into extending infrastructure in comparison to regular maintenance?

Story of TSLA is a story of great marketing to consumers and investors alike. Elon Musk sells idea, not cars. Since Steve Jobs very clearly demonstrated that consumption can be immaterial, the immaterial consumer industry has exploded into dominance. People want to belong to ""elite club of bringers of bright future.""

Most hedge funds can't even beat the indices, and they have a lot of people doing their research. If its truly about fundamentals why is TSLA worth more than F (in  all metrics), how did GME get over $300 a share, who was buying VIAC at $100 (and it's not just Bill buying)....Its EMOTION   - fear /greed... YOLO/FOMO. 

IS a fair price for AMC $20 or $15 .... YES if someone is willing to sell or buy it. Good luck with all your DD research, because you won't find the answer. 

Remember you are in a mental WAR with every other trader, hedge fund, stock holder. You are trying to take their money and they are trying to take yours. On every trade the buyer and the seller, both think they are doing the right trade, yet both have their reasons to buy or sell. 

I watch market sentiment and charts, that my analysis. I usually have both longs and shorts at the same time (so market sentiment only plays a small part of my decision). Cut your losses, NEVER let a stock go 20% against you. If after I enter a position and its working against me, when I start looking at P/E or value.....I'm already F\*CKed.  I have to remind myself I don't trade fundamentals; I trade emotion.

But some choose to stay put and not climb the corporate ladder, because in that situation, higher pay does equal more stress and less sleep. The software engineers at Tesla, for example.

How do you determine what the fair share is for everyone? Listen man, I'd like to hear some of your solutions for this.

[Coinbase (COIN) - COIN is the most respected, USA based regulated cryptocurrency exchange trading at just 21 times earnings. It is the most secure crypto exchange and has a 56 million user base with 11% market share. 90% of their revenue comes from fees that they have held steady. Coinbase is one of the top 5 most profitable exchanges, of any type, in the world. Coinbase might make more money than Nasdaq. Why I like COIN is that it is a play on Bitcoin *AND* all the other coins out there...whereas bitcoin is just a play on bitcoin, so you are getting all the other coins for free. For now, COIN is heavily (96%) tied to the price of bitcoin, which is very hard to predict but they are rapidly diversifying their revenue streams (NFT marketplace; custody agent for Facebook's crypto Novi wallet and SoFi's crypto offering and others; starting a media arm; crypto derivatives; Coinbase cloud; etc). Another advantage of COIN is it being the first crypto exchange coming on to a major market exhange is that they potentially can use their stock as currency to buy any other competitors. And you don't have to believe in the crypto party line and the dangers of fiat currency and how you need an alternative, because central banks all over the world are printing money like crazy - even if you think this is nonsense, we know that there is a market for this kind of nonsense because gold bugs have been saying the same thing for decades. In other words, crypto has a natural constituency. Like gold, people buy it as a kind of inflation insurance and gold's strength is its scarcity - its supply only increases about 1% per year and it is getting harder and harder to find more - that sounds a lot like Bitcoin to me and I think it is totally legitimate to believe that crypto, in general, can rival gold as a storehold of value.

China: 2022 will be the last year of subsidies.  2023 will tell the story better for china: we will see if there is going to be a lot of growth.   we don't see much EV in countries without subsidies (ie. chile, kazakhstan, greece, etc.). Population of USA + EU  is about 0.8 billion. China is about 1.4 billon.  World population is about 8 billion.  so about 5.8 billion of people do not have access to government subsidies for EV.  If EV was that cost effective, you would have see a bunch of EV in countries like philippines, sudan, peru, etc; but we don't. we see a bunch of corollas, rav-4, cr-v, sentra,  etc.  So where does TSLA fit in this?  Tesla sells very expensive cars.  It is out of reach to many people.  They just announced that they are not working on the $25K car.   It is debatable if Tesla is a ""luxury"" car or not.  What is not debatable is that it is priced as one. the projection by 2027 there will be about $655 billion in sales in the luxury market (source:https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/10/22/2318987/0/en/Global-Luxury-Car-Market-Report-2020-2027-to-Hit-USD-655-0-Billion-at-a-CAGR-of-9-3.html) . I am estimating about $55K/vehicle. so about  11.9 million vehicle in 2027.  Tesla can only get these type of margins selling high priced cars.  Lower priced cars: the margins are lower.  There are a limited amount of people that can buy these luxury cars in the world.  I think it is difficult for tesla to sell 10 million cars (much less 20 million) with the margins that they had in Q4 2020.  But certainly things can change and their margins might be higher than what they had in q4 ~~2020~~ 2021. Time will tell.  Hybrids will be here for some time, especially for 3 row suv or pickup trucks because they are simply too expensive in BEV form.](/r/stocks/comments/sfgnde/an_actual_tesla_valuation/huqpdxb/)

[That‚Äôs the beauty of GME. So many hodlers waiting for the price to drop to scoop up more shares which will then be DRS‚Äôd. So if for some reason the float isn‚Äôt already owned by retail (most likely multiple times over), it will be very quickly if the price drops to a certain point. GME holders have locked up almost 13million shares since around Aug/Sept 2021. Once the float is proven to be locked through DRS, the shorts are absofuckinglutely fucked. P.S. those 13million shares already locked up are mostly not holdings from retirement accounts since locking ira shares is a taxable event that most do not want to deal with. Personally, I have 14x the amount of shares in my retirement accounts than I have directly registered in Computershare. No clue what the average multiple is of shares DRS‚Äôd vs shares held in retirement accounts but I imagine it‚Äôs a lot more. So the float and even total shares outstanding are most likely already owned (multiple times over) by retail. When shorts fail their margin calls, they have to buy back the float multiple times over which means we can ask for whatever price we want technically. If the price drops, apes buy more more at a discount which leads to more DRS. If GME were to reach say $10 again, so many apes would buy. The shorts are stuck.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uo2zzm/what_happened/i8ehj2r/)

Like today's 8% gain or so is another opportunity for HF to short again.


But because they want to manipulate the price downwards, and realistically they know they cant, so it has to be a multi-technique by:

1) Route retail orders to internalization / darkpool. 

Honestly, broker is there to do a business. It cant be justified for paying various exchange fee just to trade 1 or 2 shares at &lt; $100 (When GME is that low like Feb 2021). So there is something called internalization (Especially for fractionals) where broker tries to find counter-party within itself first (Why go to exchange / MM when you can match a buy-sell trade within your own customers).

With this logic, internalization is ok (At the expense of volume likely not reported, I could be wrong) but not dark pool (Where more significant orders are simply routed there rather than to affect price discovery)

2. Like u/bosshax has [mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nhtg1p/the_nbbo_best_price_is_only_determined_by_round/), only round lot (Multiple of 100 shares just like options) affects NBBO which is price discovery and where HFT algo designed to beat it, it is not ok to route round lot orders to dark pool as a way to surpress the price.


Ideally, the best (fair for retail) case is where those odd lot orders are packaged into round lots and send the grouped orders to lit exchange directly. Otherwise, the MM process the trade in these grouped orders.


But due to the way how NBBO works as above, an easier way to manipulate the price would be:

* Group Buy (Especially Market Buy) orders in multiple of 99. Remember only 100, 200 shares count. In the case of 99 shares, it doesnt affect NBBO aka real buy pressure that affects algo.

In the case of 121 shares as example, there is 1 round lot and an odd lot of 21 shares. So it should be treated separated but meh......

* Group Sell (Especially Market Sell) orders in round lot. This would likely be what SHF short sellers does anyway.




TLDR: Apes has Buy N Hodl, DRS but so does SHF / MM has Darkpool &amp; Regroup the orders to lit exchange when necessary to achieve the ""best outcome""



It was once a conventional that this battle was not over and tendiemen will come soon. But by now, all should realized that the game is rigged, shorts have a plenty of ways to avoid unlimited losses in reality. But GME is still solid investment in the sense of TSLA or AAPL in 2000s instead",positive

I have read quite a number of comparisons of the Smart Cruise systems over the past two years and in every comparison Cadillac's Super Cruise beats Tesla's Pilot, no matter which organization did the comparison test.   Now this most recent Car &amp; Driver comparison did have some facets of Pilot they reviewers thought were major improvements and in fact better in those facets than SC.   I haven't seen any comparisons of them with Blue Cruise.  And neither are near FSD.   That is Waymo's position and only Waymo now.   You can hail a FSD driverless Waymo Taxi in Tempe if you like.  Tesla is year's away from that ability and may never gain that status as Musk has decided not to include LIDAR in the Tesla system.

This guy does a good job of explaining the parallels between investing in real estate and using stocks.

I wrote about this with my old account but my old account was somehow completely erased literally while i was logged in and redditing. I am a huge Tesla fan and genuinely believe that in a decade the stock will be worth many multiple times what it is right now. I got lucky and finished my divorce right before the 2020 crash and over the next year purchased about $73k worth of stock. I got lucky with the timing and it grew to about $530k. 

At day 1, with $530k of assets, I could borrow up to 60%, or $318k, without getting a margin call and having to sell stock, so I borrowed slightly less than $300k to purchase more $TSLA. I again got lucky with timing, and $TSLA nearly doubled again. Since my loan-to-asset ratio was now way less than 60%, I borrowed again to purchase more. I likely won't purchase any more stock on margin loan, so now I have about $750k of debt for stocks that are worth about $1.9M. As long as Tesla keeps disrupting different markets and becoming more efficient, which it will for many many years to come, the stock price rises while the debt stays roughly the same.

In my loan I pay 1% plus an annual $2k fee, so over the next year I'll add $9500 in interest to my loan, but as long as the loan-to-asset ratio is below 60% I won't pay back anything. Let's be stupidly conservative and say Tesla triples again in value by 2032 and is worth $3k per share. 10 years times about $10k in interest each year means that I've added $100k to my debt, but the stock value has gone from $1.9M to $5.7M. I  can use debt to purchase a car, vacations, a house, or whatever I want. 

If I die at this point in my example, the loan amount of $850k is deducted from the value of the assets, then my children inherit the rest of those assets valued at $4.8M. Since they inherited those stocks at a value of $4.8M, they will not pay any capital gains tax if they choose to sell.

Long post, but if you choose a good investment you won't pay any taxes and it's completely legal",positive
"If you're looking for bright spots today, IWM is trading much better than the overall markets.  Bonds have held up very strongly the past week and now that they've caught a bid, stocks can too.

Small caps are holding up very well today; in aggregate they're back to 2018 levels.

Most of the weakness right now is in the names that were strongest, stocks like AAPL and MSFT that held the S&amp;P 500 up are now leading it (and the Nasdaq) down.

I think we'll see a long-term rotation to small caps (i.e. IWM) that will last for a few years at the end of this.

Stocks like AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, GOOG are already trading as if everything will go right for them over the next 3-5 years.  It's hard to justify P/E or P/S expansion on those names in a high rate environment with the Fed removing liquidity.

Small caps on the other hand are trading as if they're basically going out of business in the short term, which we know isn't going to happen.  And they'll benefit from inflation in terms of their high indebtedness being mitigated.",positive
"Thanks for your reply. I'm thinking about selling all of my APPL and QQQ, and adding a third fund to compliment my VTI and VXUS - any ideas as to a third fund that would compliment these two well? Also, how would you recommend that my percent allocation looks?

Edit: I've decided to go 70% into VTI and 30% into VXUS. I am also thinking about selling half of my AAPL for TSLA - thoughts? Is there a better stock that you would recommend?",positive
"Well sir, the answer to that is very long and I recommend you do research but I can summarize it for you.  

Tesla=Stock of the future

F &amp; GM = Stocks of the past

A large factor to consider is that TSLA has very low debt and large cash position, where as F and GM have around 100B in debt.  

With cars alone TSLA would be a better buy than both.  They are the only company to prove that making production EVs is profitable.  Frankly, they are already 5-10 years ahead of competition and everybody is playing catch up.  They are ramping up production with new factories opening and will produce insane numbers this year. 

Another benefit of owning TSLA is that they have businesses that are either in their infancy (Energy), or do not exist yet (AI).  The value of these cannot be projected but one can imagine that if executed would be worth a lot.  

Energy (Solar &amp; Battery)

AI  (Self Driving cars &amp; Tesla bots after)

Think about where the world is going.  Its green.  They energy crisis from the Russia situation shows that we cannot be reliable on fossil fuels and need to be getting sustainable energy.  Tesla is leading the world in Clean Energy, EVs, and AI.  They have the top talent in engineers and a special CEO who pushes the envelope.  

Obviously I am bullish on the company but I believe that if you really read this and do your own DD, you will see why you should own one over the other two.  

I personally believe that not owning TSLA will continue to be the biggest mistake of any investors portfolio for the next 5-10 years, but hey, I'm just some guy on reddit.",positive

"[Nobody can look at their earnings and say they're doing badly. The price right now is based on their earnings going down. So P/E 13 seems low, but if their earnings sink, pretty soon they'll be $53 and P/E 20.  By using an outdated process, it's harder for them to compete without cutting price significantly, so they'll only be used where energy use and performance aren't critical.  Apple wasn't a huge loss, but they were still 5% of processors. Amazon is starting to make their own server chips. Microsoft is doing the same. If they lose more market share to AMD, you can see how this is a death by 1000 cuts. The only way they stop those trends is by returning to be a market leader where their customers can get great performance without maintaining their own processor design department.  The only reason all these fab-less makers have risen up (AMD / Apple / ARM) is because Intel was way too complacent. In a world where Intel is best, Apple doesn't make their own chip and AMD is seen as the budget brand. Intel never pursued the high end micro controller market like they should have, which is how ARM became the giant they are. So the new CEO has an opportunity. He's got name recognition and a mountain of cash. If the new fabs go well, they manufacture good GPU's using TSM and they can get to 3 nm feature sizing, they will be a player again.

If you want invest in long term AMD is pretty good choice. Intel is not a great choice.

They are investing in a fab in AZ which won‚Äôt come to full capacity for couple of years. Plenty of other semiconductor manufacturing companies.

I think support, resistance, triangles, wedges, EMA/SMA all work if enough people are also following them, but value and momentum indicators are by far superior, even if they lag behind a little bit. I would rather know what people are doing (buying/selling indicated in momentum) than hope people abide by the same lines I do. And almost everyone uses RSI, so that one is a pretty good tell.   RSI however can‚Äôt be the only indicator you use because if buying goes up, so does the RSI, which may lead you to think it will correct downward, but plenty of times the buying decreases enough to move sideways instead of upward, canceling out the sellers but not causing any downward movement while the RSI corrects.

"&gt; All widely reported

Then cite me some please.  The major news media **loves** Tesla stories like this, they report them all they can.  Except somehow they're silent here.

In point of fact (again, other than the simple truth that the car did burn) there are conveniently no witnesses to any of this, except the owner, speaking through a lawyer on twitter, who hid the evidence and Just Turns Out to have been heavily short TSLA.

I love that we're doing this again.  Please spin us all this yarn again.",positive
"No, they actually are. They've defended the KKK and neo-nazis many times. Elon Musk just masquerades as a free speech advocate on social media, because he has to stay in the public eye or TSLA will start to tank.",positive
"Exactly. This criteria would miss a lot of massive movers like TSLA. I guess the reasoning is that a ""beaten down"" and neglected stock *might* have the chance to break out massively. Stockbee talks a lot about this, and KK did adapt his strategy from Stockbee. But it doesn't seem to be what KK preaches (from what I've seen ‚Äî haven't watched every single stream). It also goes against a lot of the wisdom of trend following from the market wizards and turtle traders. Those trend traders specifically look for *new* ATH's, not large distances away from them. 

I don't have the data to refute OP's article/claims that dropping 70% from ATH increases expectancy, but I am skeptical.",positive
"In various discussions (such as the Lex Friedman podcast) Elon's has been talking about how they they rewriting sections of the stack, have their own custom C compiler, and are doing other ""bare metal"" kind of things. When you are doing so many code optimization techniques, clearly you are running out of compute cycles.

It's great work but they are going to hit diminishing returns.

How are they going to handle it?  Who knows?  Probably keep delaying for now. And it depends on what the contract says. There will probably eventually be some sort of lawsuit and settlement.

Yes, they can swap out the computer but who knows if a successor will be able to do the task. And they might not have enough power to the board and/thermal ability to cool the board.

I certainly think anyone that buys it now for $12K is crazy. You are just buying into a lawsuit settlement or maybe an upgraded board.

"I'm all in for a good speculation and the 'why's' - but I don't care about Tesla as long as it remains so blatantly overvalued.

The fact it has 3 times the marketcap of a company that makes 4 times more money (Toyota) just screams 'correction in near future'.

If you're holding TSLA now, you're either overpaying because you didn't do the math, or you truly believe that TSLA will increase it's profit margins by 12 times fold in near future - which is.... VERY optimistic.",positive
"Thanks for doing this, been wanting $TSLA to tank. Thank you!",positive
"Magikarp is the TSLA guy, I never held any TSLA. I actually think EVs are due for a reckoning as well; they seem to be the one part of the growth market that is still happily floating along with valuations assuming a best case scenario for every aspect of their business. Even with them all being off their ATHs.

I don't think PLTR even needs to have the market to itself to be able to grow in valuation from here. The market for data is growing massively YoY and will continue to do so.",positive
"I must admit I made a TSLA comparison earlier, but my point was more about market disruption (which does take time). Either way, I plan to hold forever, but I was hoping to encourage some people with patience.

NASDAQ:NVAX / 11

[I am not able to buy the ‚Äúplan by looking into the past numbers‚Äù logic. Companies evolve and change by offering new products &amp; new technologies that create new value. One of The biggest problem we as a species face today (other than climate change) is the issue of Covid. Its the prism through which so many of our day to day decisions are being made. In addition to this, Covid is clearly with us to stay, as the virus evolves, our vaccines have to evolve to provide us the protection we need.   In addition to this, hardly 45% of the world has received a full set of vaccination. Even in the US about hardly 70% have received full vaccination. The MRNA vaccines have low transportability &amp; low shelf life due to their sub-zero storage requirements. Plus, it looks like the MRNA vaccines effectiveness reduces after about 6 months.   All this brings me to a fee crucial points-  1. We need an effective protein based vaccine that can be easily transported &amp; stored across tropical climates in order to ensure that we are able vaccine the 55% of the world that remains still unvaccinated - this includes the folks who are reticent towards receiving MRNA vaccines. Here, Novavax plays a very important role, since their vaccine seems highly effective &amp; is robust enough to subsist in higher temperature storage facilities. But they have to get their manufacturing act right!  2. We are going to require boosters every so often (6 months to a year), here Novavax is working on a technology to couple Flu &amp; Covid booster vaccine into one easy shot. This saves people time, side effects and an extra shot on the arm &amp; the pain.   3. Protein based vaccines are cheaper than MRNA based vaccines (due to a lot of different reasons) - $23 vs $16 or so. Here again Novavax scores big, especially as it relates to buying vaccines for the 2nd &amp; 3rd world.  In my understanding, these are reasons for the analysts‚Äô estimate of the lowest price point for NVAX share to be at 205, and the highest at 305.](/r/stocks/comments/romjgb/nvax_a_good_undervalued_play_with_a_low_float/hq151tt/)

And their combination flu/covid vaccine is ahead of its competitors in terms of effectiveness and trial phase. Finally, they‚Äôve lined up a bunch of APAs that, once collected on, could make this stock a really compelling opportunity.

"[Apple and Microsoft earnings were weird too. And Netflix.  It's mostly because they report earnings and people get stoked and then they give projections for 2022 and people run away and hide, using shares to wipe their tears.  It's just not going to be a nice year for the global and U.S. economies.  I'd check the market data for options out on AMD.   I heard there was some heavy volume betting by people about if it'll hit or miss. I'm not sure if puts or calls were more prevalent. I want to say puts?...   I have zero idea what their earnings whisper numbers are.  AMD popped 8% today so... I dunno, maybe it can jump in a big way again but that would take some really big numbers on their projections. People might have bought so they can sell after earnings. I dunno.  My 65/35 guess is that it will finish lower than today by the end of the week.  And the whole week may go off a cliff. It's all going to be about projections and earnings that come in from AMZN, FB, GOOGLE.

[&gt;Why are we seeing such beats followed routinely by stock prices cratering?   The stock price has risen faster than earnings can justify in many of these cases. If stock price rises dramatically, you would expect that earnings have increased at a similar rate in order to justify that growth.   Because earnings have not increased at the same rate as the stock price, though earnings have been beating for the most part, they have not been beating enough to justify the giant gains many stocks have made.   Subsequently, the prices tank. When the earnings call starts, investors get a deeper look at the earnings beyond the numbers.  If the wrong tone is struck by corporate executives, it can fuel more selling, as we saw with NFLX earnings.](/r/StockMarket/comments/sgz278/some_interesting_news_in_barrons_over_the_weekend/huzizrs/)

[You are right about not timing the market and all those nice blanket statements no body can argue with. You are free to think and do whatever you think is right.      Yet a real investor, especially an institutional one, will always try to time the market and they do it well. They do not attempt to call every peak and every dip but they get the general trend where the market is headed in the next year or two. As a retail investor you may not have the same resources as an institutional investor but you still have more data at your fingertips than any institutional investor before the year 2000. The point is you could still try to at least time your entry and here‚Äôs why.      If you entered the market at the height of dot com bubble in 2000 you would have stayed in the red until 2007. And assuming you are not Michael Burry or one of the few investors who thought it was a bubble, you probably did not sell in 2007 and waited until 2012 to breakeven. That doesn‚Äôt even account for inflation.      So yes you can time the market, you don‚Äôt have to be very precise at it. You don‚Äôt have to time every peak and every dip. I personally had cash on the side from a while ago. I sold AAPL at 180 and got lucky with ATVI and sold it at 85. When the dip happened, I bought back into AAPL and NFLX. The dip presented an opportunity and i took it rather than buying at ATH. Here, i did time the market, but i dont have to be precise.

[&gt; So please explain to me why you think that explosive growth is needed for the stock to do well.  Your original post says that they post ‚Äúdouble digit growth‚Äù and that they do so ‚Äúevery quarter‚Äù. The fact that this is only recent seems meaningful given that this is literally the *only* argument you‚Äôve provided in a very short post.  I‚Äôm not saying they *need* explosive growth to do well, I am saying that the assumption of posting double digit growth every quarter isn‚Äôt a good one and it‚Äôs only true in very recent history.   &gt; It‚Äôs cheaper than KO despite being a higher margin business and obviously higher growth potential.  KO is a consumer staple, and as you pointed out, not a growth play. Part of valuing a stock is accounting for risk. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs necessarily fair for KO to have a higher PE than GOOG ‚Äî but certainly the argument can be made that looking at consumer staples and their performance during the GFC, compared to growth companies, tech companies, etc ‚Äî KO might be way safer and that helps valuation. You said it yourself ‚Äî growth *potential*.  &gt; Analyst estimates actually expect growth to be negative for 2022.  It seems like you‚Äôve kind of answered your own question as to why the performance may not be super stellar right now then. There is risk people are attempting to price in. I am *sure* that if Google were to execute to perfection and continue to grow through the next decade at an explosive rate, the price would then reflect that.

KEYWORD : GOOG DATE : Wed Apr 13 02:25:33 2022 SUBREDDIT : stocks



[I'm not suggesting GOOG is a bad buy, but keep in mind they had an insane jump in revenues and operating margins over the last couple of years thanks to the increased online ad spend from COVID. I have no idea how sustainable last years revenue or margins are, but if I were buying here that's something I'd want to know.  GOOG also has a lot of exposure to small business and small business could struggle in an environment of high inflation, tightening monetary policy and potentially a recession. I have no idea how likely small business ad spend is to drop from economic weakness, but it's a risk to be aware of.  Finally 22 PE is not a bargain. 22 PE is somewhere around the average valuation of what a mega-cap growth stocks might have traded at historically. I feel like we're forgetting that stocks like AAPL used to trade in the teens and GOOG has often traded in the low 20 PEs.  My fear with tech stocks right now is that we're comparing valuations to those of the last few years during a period of time when they've all been extremely elevated. A forward PE of 22 for GOOG is around average historically, which doesn't seem quite as attractive when you consider the fact rates are going higher everyday and GOOG has possibly had an unsustainable run in recent years. It could easily go lower. A high teens PE wouldn't be crazy for GOOG right now given the growth risks and market sentiment right now. Although, if it did fall that low it's hard to imagine it not being a crazy good buying opportunity.](/r/stocks/comments/u2ep2q/googl_pe_is_22/i4ijfxc/)

[I'd look more at forward PE personally. Analysts aren't expecting much growth this year given their results over the last couple of years which is making the trailing PE look more attractive that it actually is. A 22 forward PE is around average for GOOG and I'd argue valuations probably need to come down a bit more given the economic risks and the fact rates are now higher than they've been for some time.  If you believe growth won't slow this year it's probably a good buy, otherwise it's just an okay buy right now. It's a good company so I'm sure long-term it will do fine, I just wouldn't expect much from it over the next couple of years.

[Not in a significantly way currently as I understand (my understanding of the space is a 2-day deep, very limited :-)) but they all use a similar concept and potentially can compete directly.  PLTR lean more on data analytics - analyze and find patterns within the data sets, initially serving mainly intelligence agency in detecting threats and such.  They gather and handle data too, but mainly for the purpose of analyzing them rather than provide a cloud storage as a service.  Many cloud data warehouse (AMZN, MSFT, GOOGLE) initially provide hosting service for data/content storage mainly, then naturally adding on data analytics to analyze data and finding patterns.  SNOW is somewhere in between - their strength is data analysis, but they provide cloud data warehouse (by using AMZN, MSFT, GOOGLE cloud service) so that their software can function.  SNOW's (and AMZN, MSFT, GOOGLE) client base are more of enterprises.  There is no reason PLTR and SNOW cannot compete for each other's business, just a matter of emphasis, capital availability, and marketing drive.  In fact, I am certain that AMZN/MSFT/GOOGLE/SNOW has gov entities as clients as well, and PLTR has commercial enterprises as clients.  PLTR can very well do exactly what SNOW does - bundle its data analytics with cloud data warehouse of AMAN , MSFT, GOOG and serving enterprise clients (if they haven't done that already.

[Coinbase (COIN)  COIN is the most respected, USA based regulated cryptocurrency exchange trading at just 13 times earnings. It is the most secure crypto exchange and has a 56 million user base with 11% market share. 90% of their revenue comes from fees that they have held steady. Coinbase is one of the top 5 most profitable exchanges, of any type, in the world. Coinbase might make more money than Nasdaq. Why I like COIN is that it is a play on Bitcoin *AND* all the other coins out there...whereas bitcoin is just a play on bitcoin, so you are getting all the other coins for free. For now, COIN is heavily (96%) tied to the price of bitcoin, which is very hard to predict but they are rapidly diversifying their revenue streams (NFT marketplace; custody agent for Facebook's crypto Novi wallet and SoFi's crypto offering and others; starting a media arm; crypto derivatives; Coinbase cloud; etc). Another advantage of COIN is it is the first crypto exchange on a major market exhange and that means they potentially can use their stock as currency to buy any other competitors. And you don't have to believe in the crypto party line and the dangers of fiat currency and how you need an alternative, because central banks all over the world are printing money like crazy - even if you think this is nonsense, we know that there is a market for this kind of nonsense because gold bugs have been saying the same thing for decades. In other words, crypto has a natural constituency. Like gold, people buy it as a kind of inflation insurance and gold's strength is its scarcity - its supply only increases about 1% per year and it is getting harder and harder to find more - that sounds a lot like Bitcoin to me and I think it is totally legitimate to believe that crypto, in general, can rival gold as a storehold of value.   As far as the criticism of Coinbase‚Äôs business model being eroded by other competitor entrants, COIN isn‚Äôt the same as a traditional stock exchange or broker, whose services are easier to duplicate. Coinbase has more comprehensive services, from custody to exchange to brokerage, and its fees take this larger suite of services into account. Handling cryptocurrencies is much trickier than holding stocks, given that crypto has a history of being hacked or lost. The company is also building out a ‚Äúsuite of services‚Äù that have recurring revenue, including a program called ‚Äústaking‚Äù that allows crypto holders to earn interest.](/r/stocks/comments/tlwm5r/whats_your_sleeper_stock/i1x13rf/)

Assuming each person does this once a day, and that the tesla-bot dominates the US market of 330million people or so, that's close to $800million a year in lost productivity that the tesla bot will unlock.

[I'm not against leverage per se. I use margin plenty, but margin is a risk:reward multiplier. It can turn a very safe play with a decent payout into a somewhat safe play with a very good payout. Which is why I'd rather hold 2x margin on something like amazon than even 1x on most meme stocks. I'm not scared of margin, I respect it as a tool albeit a dangerous one, which makes it all the more mortifying to see it abused.  I think if you really need to use the market to get a weekly paycheck you're way better off with selling options. Relatively consistent week to week gains and in the case of CCs typically just means holding companies you'd already be holding (and accepting potential upside limits). This requires a sizeable account, but frankly I don't think you should try to live off the market if you're sitting in a 5 figure account or less.  &gt; You can't do that buying stocks on dips based on fundamentals. You will probably do fantastic in the long run, but that doesn't matter when your goal is short-run income.  You absolutely can. I primarily swing trade MA, V, AMZN, and AAPL along with a few others and usually by the time one is about done running up another is bottoming out a support or close to it. If I can't find anything I expand the list.

"Digging into this. Using your post to share what I've found so far and will maybe do a separate post if I find anything significant.

The term cross-chain refers to cross blockchain. Currently it's only using Solana as a mean to register the live data feeds in a blockchain and will extend to Ethereum and another one.

On price action. Of all the equities they receive data only GME and Moo vey stock shows ridiculous price action. The others AAPL, AMZN, GE, GOOG, NFLX, QQQ, SPY, TSLA don't show anomalies compared to what we see on trading hours.

They are relying on 3 or 4 data providers atm as it is in test and not full DeFi (untrusted sources could manipulate the data). But they want to go full DeFi in the future and have anyone with legal rights to distribute data to contribute to the network.

The 3-4 data providers Virtu Financials, IEX, GTS (gtsx.com), and maybe Jump Trading Group (not confirmed if they only provide data on crypto markets or equities too). They are responsible for the data's accuracy and uninterrupted streaming. They must be first party provider and an authorized owner of the data. I'd exclude IEX since they share their data on their website and we didn't hind such anomaly but that's speculation we don't know if they share the same thing we see.

The anomaly must come from one of these 4 and that's it.

When you copy/paste an adress in the Solana Explorer you get an Account page that's basically empty, maybe just a shell to register the trade on the blockchain. There's more info on their documentation regarding Accounts. Will look into it tomorrow.

On low confidence in GME and Moo vey outliers. I believe they use realized transactions not unrealized orders.

[Good to see some actual discussion. Thank you for this.  1. I don't know anything about metaverse and how that will turn out, that's why I only talked about Meta's current product portfolio. 2. Apple and Google are the only 2 companies that can impact facebook. They can impact almost anyone. That doesn‚Äôt say anything much about lacking moat but more about Facebook leaderships strategic mistake in thinking that these two platform giant will always allow Facebook to have free reign.  Yes, it can go down if Android decides to do the same. But, Google itself is an ad company and there would be antitrust concerns if it decided to have special treatment for itself and not allow Facebook to enjoy that treatment.  I would say, it‚Äôs more of a return to norm in matters of privacy than anything else. I don't think it counters the long game of FB at all.  3. https://techxplore.com/news/2021-01-whatsapp-terms-monetize-app.html#:~:text=Facebook%20aims%20to%20monetise%20WhatsApp,they%20already%20do%20in%20India.  Facebook aims to monetise WhatsApp by allowing businesses to contact their clients via the platform, even sell them products directly using the service as they already do in India.    ***and lastly, I am suggesting buying Meta as more of a short term play (that's obvious, given the nature of the sub), not a 50 year buy and hold.

"[It's just a mix of my personal conviction and a little bit of me not liking a few of the other companies for various personal reasons.   Windows is on billions of computers around the world; MSFT owns dozens of companies that millions and millions of people use every day (GitHub; LinkedIn just to name two); and their cloud and data center business is now exploding and set to carry them for the next decade, at least. SaaS is the best, easiest recurring revenue model in the market right now, in my opinion. It's my top reason for liking the company.  I think FB is probably a decent bet to beat the market right now, but I don't invest in companies I despise. It's unethical data mining practices turn me off. I also personally know more people leaving the platform than people who are excited to use it. People are growing tired of social media, in my experience.  Same goes for Amazon. They're digital Walmart to me. Low pay for employees and gutting local retail with prices brick and mortar can't match. Now, if they'd spin out AWS, I'd be in...  I don't use Apple products personally, and I find their hardware to be expensive for the brand rather than the performance. Like FB, they're probably a good bet to continue to beat the market -- everyone has a phone, and their footprint in China grew some 80% last quarter, a record for them -- but I invest in what I know and use, which isn't Apple products. I'm also not crazy about retail stocks, which could also be applied to Amazon. Again, give me all the SaaS; it has so much less overhead.  I think Netflix is a bad product in general and I no longer use it. I find their original content to be horrible and their service to be expensive. Same as FB, I personally know plenty of people leaving their platform. If I'm out of the service, I'm out of the company.  I don't have as much to say about Google. I use a lot of their products and services, sometimes without even knowing it's Google owned. Anti-trust legislation is a real concern with Google (ironic if I like MSFT, I know). It's a company I'll probably end up putting some money into at some point, but right now I'm more excited about other opportunities.  BUT ... I've been at this for only four months! So, PLEASE don't just take my word for it. Do your own DD too before making any investment!](/r/stocks/comments/qhvgrf/amazon_badly_misses_on_earnings_and_revenue_gives/hii0q87/)

"No, I think he will be just fine. We have to look at news coming from MSM with a grain of salt.

With that said, I would sell TSLA for different reasons now. I'm saying what I would personally do. I'm not recommending this",positive
"&gt; are moneyness and delta typically going to be about the same

No, and that is one useful aspect of delta, to have a measure to compare options and underlying stock.  

If Implied Volatility is large, the percentage of a stock value will be a larger, than for a low IV regime.  

Compare TLT to, say, NVDA, or TSLA.  

When IV is low, delta changes rapidly from at the money.",positive
"I think your plan to invest regularly is great but I think you should spend some more time researching investment options.   10% of your portfolio in McDonald's?  Make sure you understand the interest rate bet you're taking with ORC.  The average trailing P/E of the top 7 holdings in SPY is 65x, or 41x if you exclude TSLA, do you like those stocks?  I don't know SDIV but am suspicious of anything paying 8% - same on QYLD although there are big fanboys on these forums on that one.",positive
How should one read CPI ( tomorrow) with respect to tsla holding? CPI high &gt; inflation &gt; bad for growth stocks?,positive
"Wow, that's an incredible cost basis. I think I'm getting nervous because I've barely made any money (yet) from TSLA. My cost basis is in the very high hundreds. But I have confidence that it could definitely double, if not triple, pretty soon.",positive
It seems like delivery numbers are priced in and Tsla will end red by end of week,positive
"Like everything else, this infographic has minor truths and big lies. I had a bit of tsla through the entire split process.The false narrative is masked by not reporting the date of the events. The biggest lie is No 7. This price post split happened after hertz news not because of shorts covering. From its ATH of 1228 on Nov 05, it plunged to below 700 before recovering to over 1000 after the second split announcement.",positive
You were just early. TSLA will likely pull back end of the week into next week as people begin taking profits.,positive
"&gt;So then what's the benefit of that high probability?  

It can work when you also apply it to high probability setups. I don't care what anyone says, to be profitable with any strategy you have to be a good trader. That includes the ability to read charts and be aware of what the Fed/macro is doing. The statistics furus who say a minimum 100 occurrences required are people with giant accounts that can withstand a bunch of max loss trades to finally become profitable. They aren't super traders, they are literally throwing shit at a dartboard hoping it sticks.  

If you flip a coin 20 times and it's tails 15 of those times, and you have a small account, you'll be wiped out long before the odds (law of large numbers) are realized.  

I don't like credit spreads anyways because they are inferior in multiple ways to short puts and calls, unless you're playing with expensive tickers like TSLA, then they are pretty much required. But spreads are more difficult to manage and the long leg of the spread totally neuters the Greeks, making you keep the trade on for longer, and time = risk.  

Delta (direction of the stock) is the king Greek though. So if you're good at stock picking direction but want a higher probability than just buying puts or calls, you can get directional with short options.  

tl;dr  
I'd ignore the long term minimum 100 occurrences stats crap and just try to be a good trader aka be good at picking the direction of equities. Delta is king",positive
"On Monday I accidentally bought 5x deep ITM TSLA put butterflies expiring this Friday (+5/-10/+5 TSLA 10/8 950p/970p/990p) in my Roth IRA for $0.02 each. They were supposed to be far OTM calls. I tried closing them but Fidelity wouldn't let me put in a debit order to take a small loss on them and no one would fill me for a credit. I also didn't have enough cash or feel lucky enough to try to leg out of them by closing them as spreads

I got assigned 1000 TSLA shares overnight at a cost basis of $970 which put my poor IRA into a [margin call](https://i.imgur.com/taPr86W.jpg) for 14x its NLV. Called them this morning to exercise the longs and I could feel the guy judging me while he was entering the request. Pretty entertaining overall and thankfully I'm only out $20 after commissions",positive
TSLA. it would drop to like $50-$150 then immediately hype it's way back up to $1000. Easy money lol.,positive
"He has to file paperwork which we should expect this week or next.

Most likely the sale will happen in dark pools / directly with some big buyers. Potentially a large fund underweight TSLA wanting to get equal weight. Otherwise MS or GS will manage the sale on public market but remember this isn‚Äôt an equity raise that adds shares / dilutes everyone. There is no dilution

Personally I think Elon normally likes to move fast so expect paperwork this week and sale shortly after. Latest would be quadruple witching which is Dec 17

He‚Äôll want it done this tax year as his taxes likely increase next year.",positive

Friendly reminder that TSLA can send tomorrow",positive
"hey, great discussion.  do you have an alternative factor-based S&amp;P 500 subset ETF you like?

regarding price/book, it's only one of the 3 metrics used in the value factor, which itself is only one of 3 factors used.  so while it does matter, it's not overwhelming.  the ETF still contains AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, FB, TSLA and NVDA in its top 10 holdings, and all of those are fairly high price/book and have a lot of intangible assets.",positive
I just want him to say something extra bearish about TSLA lol,positive
"If your trades are normally distributed with 0 predictiveness, then your PnL per trade (normalised by volume) is N(k, x) where k=fees. 
On equity markets, fees are typically 0.002-0.005 per lot for liquidity taking 
Lets assume you have a standard deviation on trade PnL (normalised by volume) of around $50 - this is pretty extreme but perhaps we're only trading high spot names like TSLA / AMZN

ok, so our PnL per lot is now N(-0.0035, 50^2). 
Lets assume we do 100k trades a day with an average volume of 100 -  this is a pretty typical quote size (thanks regNMS) - so 10M shares traded. This is a low side estimate for any large equity HFT firm

What is the probability that we make any money on a given day?
our PnL per day is Z~N(-0.0035 *1e7*, 50^2 * 1e-7). 

If you want to rearrange this, this is a 7e9 sigma event. 

To rephrase, in this case we're just going to be paying 35k per day to spin our money round.",positive
"Good question, I believe that these 5 will be tremendous gainers over the years to come, and would still be on the list.

TSLA
AMZN
AAPL
GOOGL
MSTR",positive
"well if you bought within last 6 month a gen would have been better :D

But I do it like you too. I Actually sold all my gens within the last month to buy more growth stock. Got 200 shares of TSLA and I am close to 1000 which is my goal for this position.

What growth stocks did you buy? I also got PLTR, RBLB and LMND",positive

"My attempt at making sense of it. 

1) Markets are *not* rational. In fact, they are very emotional. 

2) Markets are, in the short term, a prediction game. When the interest rates rise, short term investors have already been dealing with it for a while. The sting is already in the flesh. 

3) *for now* (caveat: sanctions!) the economy is doing fine, many companies like TSLA and NVDA are going like trains. I think that a lot of investors are on the sidelines, and more get in by every ray of sunshine. Like me, *they want to believe in a rally*. 

This was the week when JPOW gave the market certainty about the interest rate policy, oil prices calmed down a bit, and it became increasingly clearer WW III is not happening. I think this explains a lot. 

Of course, all this will change rapidly if it turns out the West has sanctioned itself into a recession.",positive
"I think Apple investors have done that several times over the years now. AAPL is the biggest gainer of all time by most measurements.

People who held Microsoft since the beginning have also done it, when Bill Gates was still CEO it went straight up but people who bought in during Ballmer's Lost Decade had to wait a long time for the big gains when Satya Nadella took over.

TSLA is probably the newest company to have done it and it did it recently though. I would have had to travel back in time and tell my parents to invest in and hold AAPL and MSFT forever and my parents might be a bit spooked if a man claiming to be their grown son suddenly appeared in their living room and told them to buy some stocks.",positive

[Why do folks think it will get approved or even close to it?  (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04384445?term=organicell&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1)  It is for covid-19 at some community hospital in Florida.  The recruitment is still ongoing, is a phase 1/2, AND is a total of 20 patients.  Even if it finishes and produces amazing results it isn't going to get approved.  It is not a phase 3 (where we look for effect).  It's ""n"" (sample size) is too small (20 patients) to get any meaningful data via statistics, i.e. ""power"".  At best the phase 1/2 will succeed, it will get a jump in SP, then come back down to where it basically is now.  Only reason to invest is to dump it on someone else on the SP jump IF it even happens, i.e. could always get the sell on the news effect which seems pretty common these days.  Their other IND's are approved, but not one other indication is even registered as ready to go.  Those are ALL phase 1/2 as well.  So you are talking about at best 10 years to get through phase 1/2 through phase 3 x2 (need two phase 3) through NDA application through 1+ years of waiting for that just to see any approval, i.e. revenue.  For how many studies they want to do they also will need some serious $$$$ so guaranteed some serious dilution along the way.

[AMD's P/E is still way to high, but lets focus on other issues:  Intel's 12th Gen was basically a half ass attempt and their chips are outperforming AMD's. But AMD does have a much better performance and power profile for mobile but I think intel may have figured that game out too (if their newest engineering samples are to be believed).  Also, the video card space was so distorted and abnormal that AMD sold out video cards that nobody wanted for 2+ years as fast as they could make them. Problem is, only people that were buying them were people who couldn't get Nvidia cards. That ship is going to sail soon too with Crypto imploding and POW migrating to POS.  Intel has been studying the failures of AMD's graphics division and taking lessons learned in order to join the discreet video card market.  If intel can make even a half decent competitor to Nvidia that spells big trouble for AMD.

[Tesla has always been overvalued.

Plus regulatory officials that investigate any ""autopilot deaths"", and Elon having a history of being antagonistic of any regulatory official. * Losing EV market share year after year. Yes Tesla is selling more cars each year (which is good) but they are losing their MOAT and market advantage. * Tesla whales caring more about stock prices than company growth. Calling for a buyback with free cash rather than reinvesting in company growth. Basically a meme at this point.

The other has almost double the margins and increasing, higher ASPs, rapidly increasing sales, is already 100% EVs, also a market leader in the rapidly increasing energy generation and storage market, competing in the FSD space and has demonstrated significant skill in AI technology, and as a result is more profitable than Toyota despite only selling 1/8th the cars.

Elon didn't destroy the shorts, he said he was a destroyer of shorts because it boosts his image and depicts him as someone fighting a system and not playing along in it.

So many people here base their opinion on Elon off of how he describes himself and what he says on social media, instead of his actions.

He could say ""Humane working conditions are important"" and people will start referring to how ethical he is, regardless of the lithium mines, workplace conditions, and union busting he does.

Well they need to be 10x more productive, which is going to need a LOT of cash, far more than they have on hand. Again this is about curves... they could simply leverage their cashflow to do this, but it might take 10 years or more to build 10 million cars a year which doesn't justify the ""one year"" valuation.

And I know, Tesla is more than a car maker... blah blah... robo taxis and solar. Robo taxi is 10 years away, solar is a low margin cut-throat business and barely factors into the valuation. Same with energy storage.

tldr; to keep this curve alive, Tesla needs monumental investment in production over the next 2 - 3 years.",positive

"Yup, still going :).  In fact, various multibagger puts and trading the more predictable/mechanical SPY moves with 0-1DTE options in the low liquidity environment have been carrying my hobby portfolio well.  E.g., as per [this last macro update comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/maxjustrisk/comments/uf33hl/weekend_discussion_apr_30_1/i6w4nkk/?context=999) on 5/1 I've been short TSLA via puts since the day after their last earnings report, though I took profits and rolled out and down since the original position.  I was thinking I would maybe update that comment series on a monthly basis, but might write one this weekend if I have time tomorrow.

Glad to see that you have been able to make the transition to full time day trading, and that you were able to find in RDT a sub that is much, much better for that purpose than MJR.

Oddly enough I probably prefer bear markets for trading because fundamentals and market mechanics during liquidity withdrawals tend to make the market much, much more predictable.  Risk and emotion management become even more critical, though, due to the speed of the moves, which I guess is what is meant by bear markets making 'real' traders.

It took them years to get their infrastructure in place to meet the demand. Once it was completed production spiked and so did sales. Fantastic. But that does not scale linearly, they will, and are, building more. But that takes time and money. 

The last few years TSLA has been the only game in town when it comes to EVs, they sold as much as they could produce. Like it or not that is changing as well.",positive
"It will not have an impact on price. There are market makers taking the other side of the trade, and that liquidity is derived from TSLA stock, the underlying (if we're talking about TSL3). So no, you can have much bigger orders filled without impacting price.

I also use what I call the micro loss system in that since with the strat we have a clear entry to the penny what I do is I set my stops like .15, or maybe 5% with options or so below my entry but I submit the order to get back in immediately if i get stopped out and as soon as I am up .25 I move stops to my entry.

"I agree charging network is much better with Tesla ; but  if OP charging network is good enough for the time and place  OP travels, then it may be a wash.

What you get with ID4 are: higher ground clearance, smaller turning circle, quieter ride, and over $12k cheaper (way cheaper price is hard to ignore).  However, model y: probably better level 2 ADAS (but I have seen video ID4 travel assist: it looks pretty good),  faster (0-60 in 4.8 s), more range, better charging network (but could be a wash for OP), and sentry mode.

"In this blossoming (heh) industry, it‚Äôs extremely difficult to size up who will stay and who will go. You‚Äôll find all over this sub tons of people with conflicting ideas about the best ways to analyze these companies. 

Realistically here- no one fucking knows. Same thing happened at the start of the car industry- an explosion of brands, lots of promise, and only a change in outside factors (usually wars, recessions) could determine who stayed (in the case of weed, politics currently) and who fell out. 

I think the biggest players will exist past legalization and then get bought out by large alcohol/tobacco companies. There are lots of upstarts with tempting low share prices, and then you have megaliths like Tilray shipping across the world, generating *hundreds of millions of dollars* in product sales. 

I like to put my money on companies with big market shares. They tend to either stick around or get acquired- for better or for worse.

If you look at the PE ratio the stock price appears to be wild and unpredictable and doesn‚Äôt make sense. If you look at the PS ratio, it pretty much follows a straight line.  Tesla and other companies also tend to follow their sales, or the expectations of future sales growth. This is because when they are small, they‚Äôre expected to grow in scale first, then switch to making a profit later.  Slow growing or declining companies are valued by their PE ratio. Rapidly growing companies and those making a loss are valued by their PS ratio, generally.](/r/stocks/comments/qo6baa/educate_me_on_the_price_of_tesla/hjllbsh/)

"[ALB announced a 4 year plan last year that involved significant investment in updating the refinery and looking at clay extraction. Since then they have been pretty quiet but just recently they went and over staked PE and several of the other companies in valley. I think they will be looking to buy all of the companies out. Probably will wait until PE confirms successful extraction and refinement with the SLB tech and then they would license the tech and start taking over the projects. CYP is probably the other side of that equation. Once they confirm extraction viability at scale for the clay ALB will spend the money they put aside. The unknown is Tesla's project and plans. South of the Spearmint McGee Claim and North of the Sienna Blue Clay claims sits one large group of claims with no known owner (BLM list an owner but they are not tied to any known company.). It is assumed this is the Tesla claims. If they get the tech figured out, which they patented, then they could be the ones to take out the clay projects. My bet is we see the consolidation in 2023 or 2024 as the demand is unstoppable and they need to guarantee production. I read earlier today we are going to need 40x the lithium in 5 years to meet EV production demand. if that pans out that adds a lot of value to all of these.](/r/pennystocks/comments/s9etsk/snnafsiev_sienna_resources_announces_permit/htncy6c/)

[ALB (Albemarle) just overstaked several of the companies in the area. No one is sure why other than to possibly project their intentions to acquire most of the valley. It has been long suspected ALB would buy out everyone in Clayton Valley to secure their deposit that they have been mining for over 60 years. The overstaking is a mystery as they could have just gone to the BLM and gotten a map showing the open claims and just staked those but from what I understand there isn't anything currently open. It is money wasted unless they have a plan so it could be very interesting in the area for a while. At minimum I expect an offer to get Pure Energy out of there since they are direct brine competition. If that happens they will license the Schlumberger DLE tech and greatly reduce their dependence on the evaporation ponds. ALB will be a good hedge on penny stock volatility if you wanted to play the big boys as well. They will be critical for US supply going forward.](/r/pennystocks/comments/s87afu/cypress_development_corp_when_will_this_lithium/hth2r53/)

"The problem with the ""their value is stock"" is that the majority of that is still hoarded value. The workers of the company still have to be producing some value for the company to be worth tens of billions.

This means that the workers simply aren't being paid in proportion to the value they're creating. That is the fundamental problem.

Stock itself is a microcosm of this: a stock certificate is a promise that the stockholder will receive value from the worker's work. Again, the worker is not receiving the value of their work.

Granted, there are a few companies whose stock price is *massively* overinflated compared to their economic value (TSLA is a huge one), but those companies are just as exploitative as many others.


----

There are only a few business models I can think of where the amount of work to produce doesn't scale roughly linearly with production - software, for example, is one. You can make an infinite number of copies of the software, but it's still work to build bigger systems - more servers means more efficient code and more administration costs, and more copies means more tech support and customer service.",positive

[The PE ratio of GM, F and Toyota is 6x, 5x and 8x.   Assuming Tesla can earn a 10% profit margin and grow shortly to $100 billion in sales, maybe it should trade at 20x earning power or about $200 billion to $250 billion, a share price of $200 to $250. There is no point in being more precise than this.   So, yes, it would trade below $400. If it was to trade like Toyota, we are talking about it trading around $80/share or lower.

NYSE:ALL / 27

[Ty for the thoughtful reply. I certainly agree that not ALL the information is given out to some random dude who decides to buy your company, that would be dumb, so to a certain degree I understand that people can go through this process to assess the ""real"" value of a company. My hesitation here is that this looks really iffy because this kind of post-hand shaking assessment is usually done quietly and the buyer comes out and declares their intent to buy AFTER all that is done with the final price. Musk at the very least looks to have exploited this by announcing his intention to buy and the handshaking etc well before he went through the more in-depth process. He's obviously not stupid, he could have kept it quiet until he was done with it, but he didn't. Backing off now will now cast Twitter in a bad light and that seems to have been his intention. That is not sensible business because now you're badmouthing the company you're buying as a ""valuable asset"" by first exposing it as a ""not so valuable asset"". I would also consider this a bad faith move but at the end of the day money talks, Twitter might still agree to sell at $30 b instead (although even that would be a crazy price if you ask me).](/r/StockMarket/comments/upcumu/fake_accounts_a_convenient_excuses_for_twitter/i8lficv/)

[To find the next FAANG stocks, we need to find out what made them great in the first place.   They were in a rising industry, had (or still have) huge moats, pricing power and great return on capital. Most of them (except Netflix/Amazon) had reasonable multiples and they were not that big yet (most were around 400b or less market cap).  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;My picks? : AMD ADBE ROKU PLTR SQ  Let's look at them.   &gt;AMD  Company has huge competition in x86 processors from intel and is basically a non-player in other architectures. The last decade Intel was asleep and has paid the price, but since semi-conductors are cyclical, it is unlikely to see the returns from 2015 onward for AMD.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;ADBE  They do fit the ""moat"" section of the FAANG stocks, but they mostly appear to professional or a niche. With their price hikes it is clear that they focus on enterprise the most. Could have decent returns, but I don't see them returns 20%+ a year. Also not cheap  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;ROKU  This is a Tivo in diguise. Most people want to watch Netflix and Youtube on their smart TV. Does not matter if the OS is from Samsung or Roku.They have 0 moat and are not a potential fang.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;PLTR  They do have a moat, but they lose money head of heels and they have big shareholder dilution. Not a next Faang.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;SQ  They are a payment provider and there are many of them now. No real moat.   &amp;#x200B;  So lets find companies:  * 10-200b in market cap * Profitable with huge ROIC (at least 25%) * A ""moat"" * Not too expensive (less than 30 P/FCF at least) * In an industry with a big runway  With Finviz I find these very interesting. Not saying they will have great returns, but for me they look more promising than your picks  * Caterpillar * Celanese Corporation * CF Industrie Holdings * Dow Inc * FCX * NVR](/r/stocks/comments/uel9je/if_you_had_to_guess_what_5_stocks_would_you_pick/i6o95rb/)

[It's clear to me from your portfolio that you're listening to the meme-loving retail investors too much.  AMC and PLTR are absolute garbage.  Dump them ASAP.  AAPL is honestly a bit overvalued here too... trading at a much higher P/E than it has historically, but at least it's not insanely overvalued like AMC or quite overvalued and way overhyped like PLTR.  AMC upped their number of shares outstanding by many multiples to where their market cap is now many times what it was even when things were going great for them.  Now they have movies being streamed at the same time as release and all sorts of other headwinds.  The retail noobs are absolutely insane to be buying it here.  PLTR is a decent company, but not a great stock.  It's trading at a ridiculous valuation (\~40 P/**S**??) based on hype and all.  It's growth rate is decent, but nowhere near where it needs to be to validate such high multiples.  Been saying this since the 30's and it's still the same dog.

"It‚Äôs not that they sold more or less. We are talking the EV landscape not ‚Äútotal sales‚Äù

Tesla sold EVERY car they made with an ever INCREASING price per model and profit on EVERY sale. 

Ford - well you would have to extract out the EV numbers are they are WAY less (obviously) and Ford really only makes profit on F150 due to fleet sales. Everything else is a wash for them. ‚ÄúTotal sales‚Äù
is a pointless metric at this point in the automotive game unless it is EV to EV sales in this case. 

It‚Äôs like comparing ‚Äúlightbulb sales to whale oil lamp sales‚Äù at the advent of electricity. In ten (?) years time or so there won‚Äôt be any whale oil lamp (new) sales. 

Ramping into the future who has the advantage - Tesla who is about to open two new giant factories and has ALL control of their process from batteries to finished car? Or Ford who has to unwind 100 plus years of ICE factory tech and worker training, supply chain, customer base bias to ICE vehicles, no battery factory that they control, etc. 

And Teslas built in the USA (California builds) are more ‚ÄúUSA‚Äù than any USA Ford at this point where a lot of parts come from Mexico. So the ‚Äúbuy üá∫üá∏‚Äù argument is moot. 

It‚Äôs an uphill battle. Simply put - in the EV race - ALL of the other companies just let Tesla pick up the football and run the entire field with it for like 50 touchdowns. None of them took them seriously - rather they spent A LOT of time, money, and energy into lobbying and thwarting Tesla (remember the bullshit about ‚Äúoh you can‚Äôt sell your cars here because of direct sales/no dealerships/ whaaa whaaa‚Äù nonsense?) 

Now they are all like ‚ÄúHUH?!?‚Äù It‚Äôs insane. It‚Äôs a pro NFL team vs the elementary age YMCA football club at this point.

If I could give one piece of universally true advice it would be this.  Taxes should be the absolute last box to check once you‚Äôve made a decision to sell.   

Take your profit when you think the price is right and pay your 20% plus state in taxes.  If it‚Äôs one of your great long term holds just sell a piece of it so there is no FOMO.  

I‚Äôve seen people lose a lot, everything plus some in one case, because they thought they were being ‚Äúsmart‚Äù about taxes.  

We bought these two brothers company for $120 million.  My CEO (we were public) wanted to pay cash, those guys wanted equity &amp; two board seats to defer paying around $25 million in taxes.  

2 years later the company was in bankruptcy, government changed reimbursements for our industry and every public company in our sector eventually filed Chapter 11.  Those two guys sold their equity for $6 million &amp; still owed the $25 million in deferred taxes.

This special dividend of $0.075/share will be paid out on March 30th with an ex-div date of March 21st.

[Why a dick as big as the Eiffel tower is not as impressive as you may think   In Kendrick Lamar‚Äôs ‚ÄúBackseat Freestyle,‚Äù Kendrick says the line, ‚ÄúI pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower, So I can fuck the world for seventy-two hours‚Äù.  While at first, a dick as big as the Eiffel tower may seem to be a dong of immense magnitude, when taking into account the sheer size of earth, the lucky one to be fucked by this dick, we realize that it is not as spectacular as the young MC claims it to be.  The Eiffel tower stands at 1063 feet, while the diameter of the earth is approximately 41.804 million feet. If Kendrick inserts his Eiffel penis into the earth, his dick would only take up .000025 percent of the earth‚Äôs vagina. That is pathetic. Kendrick is not fucking the world for 72 hours with his Eiffel tower micropenis. The Earth will get bored after 10 minutes and finish herself with a vibrator the size of Argentina.

NYSE:MA / 6

[i think as a day trader there's no real way to catch the whole move unless you luck out. price could have probably turned around at any one of those dotted lines you have (considering they're accurate).  but to answer your question i think you would have first noticed such a move was possible based on HTF's. once price hit that orange dotted line perfectly, assuming you drew that before it got there, just look for candlestick confirmation patterns. set your risk below last low. once it breaks structure (with volume) and on top of that managed to get above the MA's look for more bullish candlestick patterns like the bullish engulfing right above the gray MA. From there, just don't get out until you see it break the fast MA's (blue and purple).  Imo any good trader would have gotten out at the yellow dotted line, but let's say you're feeling risky or left a runner. just draw fibs from the last impulse before the resistance line and if it hits a fib with a rejection candle then ROLL THE DICE. 7's all day baby. Then take it to a fib extension.   it all started with HTF confluence and accurate key levels. that would have been my approach.](/r/Daytrading/comments/tyzpsy/what_can_i_use_to_predict_the_turn_of_long/i3y82ns/)

"I sell CC with TSLA. I want to continue holding for many more years and can stomach the roller coaster. The drops don‚Äôt hurt because I want to continue holding anyway. In fact, drops are a good thing when selling CC because your strike becomes further OTM. 

If you are at risk of being assigned you can always roll up and out. That‚Äôs the beauty of covered vs naked (margin) calls. The thing is you always need to have some cash handy in case you are now deep ITM and the new premium is less than the cost of the roll.

Inflation is ""happening"" because it is being captured by the CPI which a measure of a basket of goods people buy to survive. The money that has been coming to middle and low income folks has been spent on the things in this basket ... to survive. This as well as many other factors like supply chain issues and greedy ass companies storing grain for the economic winter is the cause for the CPI metric to go up which means inflation is now happening. 

The fed printed money went to the banks and the uber rich and the corporations which don't buy CPI basket things to survive. It went into real estate and the stock market ... which ... is wildly up over the last decade .... because of inflation which isn't measured by the CPI.

"[You‚Äôre bagholding a company that is operating at a loss of over $100m a quarter and burning through their cash reserves. They‚Äôve leased two new distribution centers to compete with Amazon‚Äôs‚Ä¶ 100+ US distribution centers and Target and Walmart‚Äôs thousands of major retail stores that also act as distribution hubs (and no, GameStop‚Äôs cramped retail spaces are not equivalent to something like a Target Super Store).   Expanding into e-commerce isn‚Äôt some magic bullet to turn around a company, it‚Äôs just the expectation for any retail company these days. E-commerce is an extremely competitive space, and GameStop doesn‚Äôt have the infrastructure, logistics, scale, or money to be price competitive, and they‚Äôre fighting an uphill battle for people to even think about shopping there before checking one of the other larger stores first. They‚Äôre about a decade late to the PC gaming and hardware boom, and selling a bunch of overpriced RBG infused accessories and PC hardware isn‚Äôt going to fix that. Look at the state of companies like MicroCenter, Best Buy, NewEgg, etc. This is not an easy market to compete in for a small to midsized retailer.  Almost no one besides GME bagholders cares about an NFT marketplace. Even if it‚Äôs successful, look at the volume being done by OpenSea and realize that it would be literally impossible for GameStop to even get close to justifying their current valuation by acting as an NFT marketplace. It‚Äôs just another space where they‚Äôre too late to benefit from being a first mover and aren‚Äôt doing anything to special to set themselves apart from the competition.  Also, they‚Äôre ‚Äúdeveloping‚Äù a game market place? You mean the core business model that nearly bankrupted them? That‚Äôs what GameStop is (or was) and it‚Äôs a dying industry. Physical media is a dying format and digital distribution is controlled by first parties who have no incentive to give up that control or to allow for digital game resale between second and third parties.   &gt;	you make it sound like I didn‚Äôt do research  No, you make it sound that way.](/r/StockMarket/comments/syqhp1/most_mentioned_stocks_over_the_weekend/hy5f5q8/)

[Imagine buying leap puts on a company AFTER an 80% draw down.  This is starting to feel like 3/2020 when everyone was going drill gang and trying to convince the world that the big slide was bottomless. But rug pulls can't last too long. Pump dumpers only have a couple of Bollinger bands down before rewards diminish and sell offs intensify toward Loserville. I'll admit this dip of dips isn't doing a thing for morale.   It's like Cuban said about GME, the lower this gets the better off bulls will be when the tide turns. I hope this bitch oversells to near squat because the lower it goes the tighter the rubber band is stretched for a bounce.

&gt;The initial loan to value ratio is 20%
&gt;
&gt;The loan can be margin-called if the loan to value ratio reaches 35%, at which point Musk would have two days to come up with cash to reduce the loan to value ratio to the reset level of 25%. Pledging additional shares to increase the collateral is not permitted.
&gt;
&gt;Assuming a starting value of $1,000 per share, **the margin call comes at a share price of $571**, at which point Musk would have to find $2.6 billion to lower the outstanding amount of the loan and bring the loan to value ratio down to the reset level. This could force the sale of some of Musk‚Äôs Tesla shares, putting downward pressure on the share price and lowering the collateral value further.
&gt;
&gt;Full repayment of the loan is also mandatory if the VWAP of the shares falls below 40% of the share price at the Funding Date. **Musk would have to find $12.5 billion to avoid default if Tesla‚Äôs share price falls below $400.**
&gt;
&gt;There is also the question of Tesla‚Äôs own policy which restricts loans to 25% of the value of the pledged shares and requires a cash injection to correct any shortfall. **That would trigger a call for extra cash at a share price of $800.**

A few key levels there:

* $400 &amp; $571: a lunatic ghey ber's wet dream, will obviously never happen pre-split, no need to even discuss these levels;
* $800: This one is more interesting. He's basically gonna be margin-called by Tesla if the stock touches $800 (which is very close right now).

The simplistic way to look at this would be the ghey ber way: oh boy Elon is dumb as fuck and he's gonna get margin called soon and launch another $TSLA sale like in late 2021, me buy puts.

However, the other way to look at this is to see that maybe Elon accepting to take such risk means that he's confident enough that $TSLA will stay above $800 for a long period of time and probably already has a plan B or some sort of news with which he can pump the stock to maintain it above that level. That piece of information he's withholding must be extremely bullish if he's confident it can maintain $TSLA above $800 ***despite*** the current shit macros.

So yeah, either that or he's indeed completely nuts.",positive

"&gt;You look at the company, if the company does good the value of your share increases.

The stock price only increases because people buy it. It is not inherently tied to profit, but yeah that's a metric to be looked at. Every tech company is valued at least 20x to 50x higher than the actual revenue they produce anually. 

The stock bros try to act superior, but it's just a different game of speculation. Tesla actually doesn't produce profit yet it was worth a trillion at the top lmfao. 

There are all sorts of nonsensical examples of bullshit speculative  evaluations, but it's a stock so it's seen as legitimate with no questions asked. 

The price doesn't go up cause the company is making money. It goes up because people will speculate it'll make more money. Like Uber, Lyft, TSLA, rivian, etc. None of this companies produce profit but they're valued at billions to hundreds of billions.

Nice plays though. I'm basically making all my money on puts these days as the premium from selling calls is way too small. Don't feel comfortable selling a few % OTM for $500 versus selling 8-10% OTM for $500 on puts. Making a few grand a week from those puts.

"[I agree. I‚Äôve been pondering and researching Roku for some time (4 years so I wish I had just bought). A friend of mine was bullish way back and my concern was market saturation with apple and Amazon. I think with Roku TV they have shown that they see this too. The ad revenue maybe small but the new source is the real excitement. If they can get into the streaming world while controlling physical devices that puts them in a whole new category. Netflix doesn‚Äôt worry about hardware they just manage the app. Roku is a hardware company that is trying to break into the app world it depends on. Which one will be a better investment?

[You say it's hard to justify it going from $500 to $125.  I say it was very, very hard to justify it being $500 at any point. I have a hard time justifying it being over $100 to be honest  They have a single product which can be (and will be, IMO) easily overrun by any of other companies like GOOG, MSFT, AAPL or even MSFT. All of those except MSFT already have a similar (maybe not as encompassing) product, and they don't depend on that single product for all of their revenue.  The only thing ROKU has going for it is its default integration into cheaper TV sets. And that comes at a cost of little to no brand awareness, since people owning those TVs have no idea they have an underlying ROKU.

[You do realize most people who buy Samsung/LG immediately stick either FireTV, Roku, or Chromecast's on it right? Tizen and WebOS are some of the worst, most ad-infested interfaces along with Vizio's smartcast.   Netflix is also not releasing a free ad supported tier. Neither is Disney or HBO, their ad supported tiers still have a monthly sub.  From what I've seen in Conviva quarterly reports, Roku increased their global market share from 31% to 31.8% from Q2 -&gt; Q4. Even if they only held their market share the same they still would have gained users because consumers are still transitioning from cable to streaming.   I don't really see streaming as a winner-takes-all market, for the same reason that Television sets and TV networks don't have a monopoly. However that could actually be a downside for Roku, if people are expecting Roku to dominate the market and factoring that into it's price.](/r/stocks/comments/tn74fk/opinions_about_roku_down_75_why_is_it_dipping_and/i2162qo/)

I was using my cable box with apps previously and cable box went to shit with recent upgrade and never went back to using it.   Roku is easy enough that my 5 years old can use it.   As an investment I think it will grow and as a placement in the market they win no matter which TV, Streaming service or movie studio wins. It‚Äôs a gateway and they can support all of them.   It‚Äôs pretty cheap now (as a stock) and can still grow a lot as TV‚Äôs are updated.

So, while many big screen devices are seeing stabilization, even more data points to smart TVs gaining ground.  And c)  &gt; Everywhere but North America, Roku had single-digit share, lowest in Asia at just 0.2% and highest outside of North America in Oceania at 7%. Amazon Fire TV fared better globally, with double-digit share in Asia (18.6%), North America (18.4%), and Europe (12.3%).

"pml1990,  

I bought TSLA stock in 2011 at a cost basis of slightly more than $6/share (split adjusted), and have held those shares to the present.  

There are never any guarantees that a company‚Äôs valuation will have a major breakout like Tesla did. 

However, I see many similarities between TSLA and PLTR as investments, even though the companies have very different products.  Palantir, like Tesla in the mid-2010s, is poorly understood even though it has what I believe is a game changing product.  

There‚Äôs no company that has the same fully integrated software platform for decision making that Palantir offers.  

When I saw the Palantir Foundry demo earlier this year, I thought it was as unique and potentially game changing as the Tesla Model S prototype was in 2011.",positive

"Lots of discussion on 5 vs 7 year loans. 

7 if you can buy the CT outright and care about opportunity cost*

5 if you cannot buy the CT outright and care about stability.

I agree with Landonianb, it‚Äôs not financially safe to extend a loan for 90% of people due to overleveraging. This gets people into hot water when unforeseen $1000 expenses (medical/somehow ruined the Goodyear new CT tires/insurance because you drove your new CT into a Mach E/FUD AP accident) pop up. 

*For the well off 10%, who can theoretically buy the CT outright, a 7 year loan is okay to capture the opportunity cost and leverage the cash flow into investments, aka TSLA. 

If you can NOT buy the CT outright, you shouldn‚Äôt be messing with longer loans in an effort to invest the difference and beat the interest rate, regardless of how low it is. 

7 years is a 2nd grader that needed diapers and health costs. A mother that needs hospice or funeral arrangement help. A dog that needed dental cleaning. An engagement ring/wedding. A LOT OF TSLA FUD. 

I know Cybertrucklv is passionate about 7 year loans, which good for them, he‚Äôs in the 10% that can afford the CT outright. 

Lastly, if you can‚Äôt buy the CT outright, you really shouldn‚Äôt be purchasing a $50k car even if it‚Äôs the national average.

Also the CEO of Stelantis said the other day that they can't make EVs at a reasonable price and make a profit.

Or if I wait one days I‚Äôll recover this losses  so is it better to just hold and wait a new tech rally?  Friend, investing all your life savings into high-risk small cap tech stocks and Chinese stocks is not a good idea. My only four speculative stocks - Cloudflare, Coinbase, Purple Innovation, and Sofi - are 20% of my portfolio, for example, and even that's enough to make me queasy when the market goes down.  I can't really give you solid advice, since I wouldn't have bought any of those other 3 except for Blackberry (and me buying Blackberry at $24 was due to FOMO). If I were in your shoes - and again, I don't how much you invested, how much you need money, how long you plan to invest, etc. But if you don't need money anytime soon, I'd hold Palantir for now. It hit $18 in the May sell-off as well and quickly rebounded to $28 within a month. So I don't see why Palantir wouldn't rise again during the next tech rally. Just know when you're willing to dump it.  BB is likely not going to $20 again, but seems to largely ebb-and-flow in a band between $8 and $12 (look at the one-year chart). So you've already lost most of what you were going to lose. I don't think this one will move much anytime soon, though it may retrace $6 if the tech slump worsens. So it's a question of whether you want to realize losses and redeploy, or want to wait and see if it bounces to $12. You could also just split the baby and sell half.  I don't touch Chinese stocks and never have. So if I had Didi stock, I'd sell it. But I admittedly know nothing about the company.  As I mentioned above, you've lost so much on Lemonade, you may as well hold for the next tech rally. With interest rates rising, however, small cap tech spec stocks like this will probably continue to get pummeled, so I wouldn't want to hold it for too long.  If you're unsure of where things will be, you can also just sell in weekly installments (20% each Friday), sell a certain amount (10%) on every up day, or something else.](/r/stocks/comments/r8y5yz/pandemic_stocks_valuation_after_the_recent_selloff/hnb48k2/)

"We as in TSLA or the market as a whole? TSLA has continued to execute well and definitely needed to catch up to 'fair' valuation. It's definitely overshot it a few times with gamma squeezes though.

The market as a whole? Did companies in the Nasdaq 2x output or real value in 2 years? S&amp;P 1.5x as the whole world largely shut down? Sure some earnings have gone up, but how much of that is because of the free money and liquidity handed out?

"So far you would‚Äôve been able to roll ccs up and out of any gamma squeezes.

Selling puts can be dangerous too. My buddy was margin called with this last dip. All their buying power was from TSLA shares. Selling atm puts at the top meant less bp from less value in shares and more margin requirements for the puts.",positive

But yeah, go ahead and down vote because you don't understand their business model and literally think it's about just selling cars.",positive

* Steering wheel made for an airplane - because Elon expects autopilot to actually work, so reasons...

Edit we are going into the end of year, taxes are due, people are pulling their investments out for the EOY. Just bc there‚Äôs selling across the board doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs automatically some conspiracy.

"Most people that live in cities don‚Äôt need bigger batteries, and also most gas cars are around 250-450 miles. Yea you get more battery for what ? 3x the price. Heck even a 220 mileage car is okay for you to drive if you have a charger at home, plugging in takes 5 seconds when you get home. I‚Äôd rather have a 250 mile car that‚Äôs 1/5th the price than this. Mercedes is just trying to say they have more range range, but most middle class people won‚Äôt even buy it. I don‚Äôt see this car selling like hot cakes like the m3 or mY are selling.

Edit: even if it‚Äôs competing with the S, the S isn‚Äôt the biggest seller or money maker for Tesla. Last year 906k model 3/y delivered and 24k model S/X were delivered‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm no mathematician but it‚Äôs pretty obvious where the profits are coming from.. longer range or premium Tesla is not keeping the lights on, tsla got nothing to worry about.",positive

Yes, indeed. New issuance is completely different from split or join.

How you read the following from Tesla 10k report:

""the five-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend in August 2020""[https://ir.tesla.com/\_flysystem/s3/sec/000156459021004599/tsla-10k\_20201231-gen.pdf](https://ir.tesla.com/_flysystem/s3/sec/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231-gen.pdf)",positive
"You can also use this a tool to sell (covered call) or buy (cash secured put) by selling call/sell at strike price; now, you get to sell/buy at that price and take more premiums on top of it. 

i.e. Say this is Friday and I want to sell TSLA at the current price. I‚Äôd write $1,030 covered call (current price) and take ~$1,100-$1,600 in premium right away. 

The only downside is if the stock goes above the current price I‚Äôm loosing profit on that. But in a long run it doesn‚Äôt matter. I have a target price anyway. And most of the time I dodge a bullet almost every week. 

Writing contracts alone make me as much as blue collar working full time for a whole year in a week, every week without fail. Mind you, I have a big port, but a kid I‚Äôm teaching is writing his medium size tech port for $1,000+ a week (I think he wrote very close to the money last week and walked away with $4K). These are all in USD, too. A lot of people would just sit around watching their stocks going up and down. Why? Make the stock work for you.",positive
4/2/22 going to be interesting to see how supply chain has been affecting TSLA,positive

"As you get closer to max profit it is better to close because they amount you are making becomes less and less so you can redeploy capital again. In addition, your gamma risks increase as you get closer to 0dte. Check out a tasty trade video called ""Making Money Trading Straddles and Strangles | Trading Data Science "" there are several  useful  graphs that help explain why to close versus the risk of holding closer to expiration. 
On a more practical  and personal note you don't know what is going to happen and you maybe able to restart the same position for more money again. For example, I had sold an 8 dte TSLA CSP and 3 days it was at 52% max profit and I had a standing buy to close at 65%, unfortunately it never hit that and yesterday IV increased so it was only at 10% max profit even though it was even further OTM.

The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth.

Easy example but if you had 10% of your portfolio in Tesla over this last year and bought and sold at the wrong time, you'd have lost several years of retirement.

If you enjoy strategically investing, this shouldn't be a difficult idea to understand.

Honestly, you're assuming everyone is like you.  That's your problem and why you don't get it.

Likely more impactful would be markets reaction to the announcement. Would it rocket, dump or maintain current values?",positive

XLP has a decent yield, but not much else going for it. This is another case where I‚Äôd just cherry pick stocks for yield, if I were inclined to tilt to this sector. I‚Äôm not. 

I like XLF, because I like Financials tilt. Having said that, I added my financials tilt (to a foundation of VTI) by adding JPM, MS, and GS as picked stocks. This allows me to check charts on pay day and be strategic with where I place that installment of investment money. That has helped each of those positions beat XLF since I built them.

"ONLY MY OPINION but to expand on what I wrote above:  


How do you determine if the indicator works for the ticker? By back testing. Review how the ticker **REACTED** over the past year to the indicator.   


I don't go further back than that because there's a lot of new people and new money in the market, so knowing what was hot 20 years ago doesn't help me today. Plus the **""HOT""** indicator changes every time Jim Cramer has an idea. What works for me is reviewing **$SPY's** reaction to different indicator. What does the price do when approaching one of the EMAs? Which is more consistent? Watch the 9EMA, 10EMA, 13EMA, 20EMA, and the 34EMA   
 and see the pattern develop.    


Volume and price movement:

**Real world example**: M*cDonald's* ***KNOWS*** *that when they discount Big Macs people buy* ***MORE*** *Big Macs. The price makes them attractive. If you're watching TV and see the ad - you go - oh wow! Big Macs are on sale. Your friends see you eating a Big Mac and you tell them they're on sale, and then they're buying Big Macs too.*  


Well its the same for the stock market.

**$SPY** is falling to the **VWAP** (example) and if enough people see it and think that's a good discount area, they buy and the price goes up. If those same people are busy watching their kids or looking at **$TSLA** instead of **$SPY**, then maybe the price keeps going down.  


*That's why you look for volume to confirm price movement.*   


Going back to the price going up example. Today their kid is at day care, and they got burned by **$TSLA**, so they are watching **$SPY** and they buy at the **VWAP.** Now the price bounces with volume. Price moving on raising volume attracts **MORE** attention and the demand goes up and so does the price. Now you have a bigger move.   


Price moves have so much less to do with company fundamentals or technicals (well not 100%), and more to do with **PEOPLE** (traders). If enough people are paying attention to a specific ticker at specific times using a specific indicator you get price movement.",positive
"Totally agree TSLA has the potential to be 100 times greater the Apple 

Never ever Bet against TSLA!!!",positive
"I agree, but if tesla starts buying the majority of new capacity from them, it's might better to just hold TSLA. Because i think 60kWh sold from CATL --&gt; Tesla makes less money for CATL than the Model 3 SR+ tesla is able to sell. So more capacity form CATL could actually mean TSLA going up faster than CATL.",positive
imagine not buying tSLA at 1k support,positive
"From my humble understanding:

KRBN is an **ETF** which mostly invests in carbon allowances.

GRN is an **ETN** based on EU only based carbon credits.

The difference between credits and allowances is worth looking into when investing in this sector.

Carbon credits represent the right to emit that carbon. These have to be purchased  by the emitter on the auction market. I recently heard that one fund was trying to buy these up, create a shortage and drive up the price. TSLA makes a ton, like $2Billion a year by selling its carbon credits on the market.

Carbon offsets represent the production of a certain amount of sustainable energy to counterbalance the use of fossil fuels. The emitter gets credits for investing in sustainable projects, thus sustainable projects sell these on the market.",positive

"In the last 3 months, TSLA has lost 1/2 as much as Amazon, and 80% of what Apple has.

The SPY is down 4% as well.

Could this be....fake news? Yes, yes it seems like it is.",positive
"that doesn't matter. The reason TSLA is squeezing and squoze is bc the shorts are playing by the rules. They made a bad bet, and they wanted to get out bc clearly the company was doing well thus the first big squeeze. 

their later movements were likely leftover shorts or new shorts which thought the company was overvalued at 200b, 500b, 1t, etc. in addition to longs buying more. 

with GME the issue is that shorts may very well be so short that they're not trying to close because its pointless. Say our theories are right and there are 200m synthetics out there. even if you buy 100m shares somehow and send the price rocketing into the thousands and above...YOU'RE STILL SHORT BY OVER THE ENTIRE FLOAT. So the solution? Keep shorting or hiding shorts or finding ways to not deliver. 

If this was the same as TSLA, then we would never have gone from 300 to 180 after the June runup. This is very different bc shorts are not going to close their positions to avoid MOASS...

for a company as innovative and mainstream as tesla, hiding shorts is futile. You're just going to get fucked, you may as well close. 

meanwhile, GME? a brick and mortar videogame store that we're told over and over to forget? a stock with likely multiple times the SI Tesla had? something tells me they were hoping to get out of this without making a big deal out of it",positive
Not wrong on this. I‚Äôve been anxious to do a YOLO on tsla when it dips to the 900s again. Probably the best way to do that is with a 2024 expiration.,positive
"Ye but what is medium risk? Tech is usually high risk. Maybe look IBM (cloud computing etc.). AMD is great stock - I already earned a lot on it. You got NVDA, obviously great pick even has small dividends. 

Then, if you are really into [g.cards](https://g.cards), INTC, opening 4-5 production facilities. NVDA looking for partnership in future, USA has microchip act. That could be next great pick. Since, I guess republicans will win next elections which will strenghten investing in domestic production. (Im on other part of world so you could know more). 

If you wanna go really WSB mode - TSLA. Great car, great CEO, WSB favorite, large volume, increasing market, increasing public investment in green energy. Maybe its not too late to join in. 

So, if you really want some value - i had IS (ironsource) - mobile game marketing platform from Israel. Now its really undervalued at 2.80$ (it was trading over 10$ last year). Pretty new one, more risky as there is a lot of competition. 

Hmmm.... what did I have more. Ah yess, the GOOG. Alphabet. Whatever name is. Trading at 2300$. I mean. Yea. 

I would stay away from Meta, fb, twtr, nflx and adbe. They already hit their highs and competition is comming to get em. 

What else can you look. Amazon, shopify, and other platforms are great ofc. I do not know how good will they perform as it is growing market with lots of competition. 

From all of this mentioned - my top picks are AMD and IS. You can check NU - Warren Buffet pick for financial technology. Affirm also good pick. 

Last but not least U (unity) and MU. I know its maybe too much chipmaking list but MU seems fine. Unity - well - everybody knows Unity, new age shit that I hate but it is the future.",positive

[I take a baseline of big tech like MSFT which has a P/S of 12 then I'll adjust up from there depending on how optimistic I am about how realistic the growth is for the company. Based on that, you can see that investors are extremely optimistic that cyber security will have huge growth. The problem with the high P/S is that if it is too high then there is also more risk IMO because there is always the risk that the growth will not meet investor expectations, even if the growth is pretty good.  I am also optimistic with cyber security.

[Interesting. Never thought about it like that and using something like MSFT as a starting point.  So basically the higher the P/S (and I guess the same point could be made for P/E) ideally means that the company isn't bringing enough money to match the price of the stock which means investors are optimistic for the future but the company has a ways to go to meet those investor expectations and may never (more risk).  On the flip side, something with a lower P/S could in theory mean it's a steal as an investment or just mean that investors aren't really optimistic about the sector?

If we were talking about 10/22 options, sure.

It is always frustrating to buy a bull call spread and realize that the calls you sold moved way better than the calls you bought, even as the stock price moved up past the lower call price.

[I just responded to your other post. Take from it what you will. I'm not bullish on TSLA right now but there are reasons why the market cap is where it is. Incorrect statements? HA.  TSLA Q1 GAAP EPS grew 633% Y/Y. Q1 non-GAAP EPS grew 246% Y/Y. So it's clear investors are paying up for growth. There's no other megacaps growing EPS that fast. Your point about 1,398 PE, yes it was overvalued then but it was also on the edge of profitability. Investors saw through the bridge to profitability and took a bet, and PE has been declining rapidly since.  Ideally if you want forward ests to get a sense of Wallstreet consensus and therefore PEG ratio, go pay up for Bloomberg / FactSet.  I don't know why I even bother with people who clearly have zero experience working on wallstreet and don't even have the full set of data backing their statements.](/r/StockMarket/comments/uuhzlh/a_good_time_to_post_this_i_think/i9kavda/)

PLTR is me putting my money behind what I think is incredible leadership. I think they have a rock solid history with the government. I dont view them as just foundry. Im buying everything they will create in the future and I believe they will continue to create value. I think im looking at a future tech giant in its early days. Its not just foundry. Its a software company with an incredible leader and a talented staff. Any argument against them ive heard is either stupid, shortsighted, or not visionary enough. I think part of the art of investing is being able to see something beyond the numbers. Its not just a numbers game, its not a science. If PLTR is the biggest investing mistake I ever make then im ok with that because I think its a risk worth taking. I think there are a lot of people just looking at their current business and I think you have to value what theyll do next even if you dont know what it is. You should be able to tell this isnt a company that just does one thing. They are a company working on new product all of the time. They reinvest in themselves and they will continue to grow while the market just looks at numbers.... similar to amazon to my mind. Then one day people will see the truth and there will be exponential growth. I cant wait for that day as an individual investor. I cant drop in a millions at a time. I have to acquire over a long period of time before the market is aware of what ive been buying. Risk is not created equal. Failure for this company is not comparable to other software companies. They have the history, they have the current contracts. Its hard because im sure millions have said the same thing about different failures but I just have faith PLTR is not the same.

[The problem is that the numbers aren't everything. (They are always important, but they're not necessarily determinative in certain circumstances, when retail traders have an emotional attachment to a particular company; consider AAPL or TSLA.) Sometimes a company trades based on valuation, and other times based on hype, hope, fear, or greed. When you're dealing with a ""story stock,"" it's impossible to predict where it'll go.   Prophecies become true because people *make* them come true. When there's a myth around a particular company, such as PLTR, it would be a grave mistake to underestimate it.

"No, what I'm saying is that a valuation model alone shouldn't be used as the determining factor in whether to buy or sell shares in a growth company.

The problem with valuation models is that many of the assumptions that go into those models become less and less certain the further out in time one looks:

* How many financial models of Apple in 2001 would have reflected iPhone sales in 2011-2012?
* How many financial models of Amazon in 2004 would have reflected AWS in 2014?
* In 2005, nVidia was just a GPU maker, but after it was discovered that nVidia chips could run Artificial Neural Networks much faster than conventional CPUs, nVidia was the leading supplier of AI chips a decade later.

Investors could have guessed at the path these companies might take, based on their leadership teams and product paths.  Apple's iPod in the early 2000s, and the trend towards convergence of portable mobile devices (MP3 players, PDAs, and mobile phones) made an Apple phone a reasonable prediction.  Same with Amazon's foray into digital logistics infrastructure -- they couldn't find a vendor that adequately addressed what they needed, so they built their own, and started selling that as a service to others.  nVidia would've been a bit harder to predict, but Jensen Huang publicly stated his ambition in the 1990's to make nVidia bigger than Intel.

I also often bring up the Tesla example, because Tesla was declared ""overvalued"" by mainstream finance almost from the day of its IPO in 2010.  It's been declared ""overvalued"" every year since.

When TSLA jumped to 190 (38 in today's split adjusted shares) the summer after a surprise Q1 '13 profit, the mainstream media was yelling that the stock was ""overvalued"".  Anyone who bought TSLA at that local peak and held through today would have 29x their wealth on that investment.

People who sold early, before Tesla reached S&amp;P500 membership, missed out on tremendous gains.

I think it's important to look at certain numbers for growth companies, usually in the SEC filings:

* Cash burn vs. cash reserves
* Overall debt
* Cash flow
* Track record of equity raises for growth companies where expenditures and debt are high relative to income
* Sales growth and cash flow trajectory

These give some indication of how risky a business is, but also the probability of when they might achieve financial sustainability without the need for more fundraising.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;God apparently tells some fund managers to buy but I am skeptical.

I agree that buying based on the perception of a deity's recommendation is a **terrible** **idea**, but it's also a **terrible idea** to make decisions based on valuation models where the variables are uncertain and can be tweaked to produce almost any result.

People instinctively want certainty.  Valuation models in many situations provide the *illusion* of certainty and therefore can lead to poor investment decisions.  This is why I recommend that people use such models as just one factor in any decision to buy or sell shares in a business.

**Edit:** a lot of growth investing is sensing the direction society and technology is going, and trying to predict which businesses will best take advantage of those changes.  

This is observation and requires some tolerance for guesswork and risk (no certain outcome), as well as a heavy dose of patience.  There are no guarantees.

[Here's what I don't like about the up coming crash.  Yes, it will happen.  It has to.  Financially speaking, the govt + Fed Reserve is being as irresponsible as always &amp; we all know what happened previously (2008).  So there will likely be another burst.  But what's different this time is that BlackRock &amp; Bill Gates are buying up property like crazy.  I'm betting that when the crash happens, they wont sell any of it.  So what happens when a crash happens, and there's nothing to buy?  Do property values plummet when almost nothing is for sale on purpose?  Remember, they want you to ""own nothing &amp; be happy.""  Last time we had a big crash, foreclosures were for sale all over the place.  Well, what if BlackRock buys all of those for 200%, 300%, or more of their actual value?  Because that's what they're doing now, BEFORE a crash.  Imagine how quickly they could gobble up property once it's been foreclosed upon.  And you don't get to buy it, even at an inflated price.  It's not going to be for sale.  It's going to be for rent.  I'm not looking forward to when ""it's private property, they can do what they want"" applies to all living spaces that nobody owns but BlackRock.  **TL;DR** If you own property, SIT ON IT.  DO NOT SELL TO ANYONE EVER AGAIN.  PASS IT ON TO YOUR FAMILY &amp; TELL THEM NOT TO SELL IT EITHER.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/usuqcj/boyz_this_is_not_a_correction_this_is_a_full/i97btp3/)

[Some people (you) don‚Äôt have the emotional control to ride out markets.  I‚Äôm down around 25% and I don‚Äôt love it, but I have 6 months‚Äô expenses in cash so I don‚Äôt give a fuck if the stock market falls another 90%.  If you‚Äôre living paycheck to paycheck or gambling on student loans/margin, I can see why you might be shitting bricks. I would be too. I probably lack the emotional control to hold in that scenario myself.   Nobody has probably ever given this advice on this sub:  You have to figure out your own emotional boundary. Some fools can‚Äôt hold their 401k that‚Äôs 100% index funds through something like this. Those poor fools. Meanwhile people like me are not only bag-holding TDOC, I‚Äôm loading up. It‚Äôs not about whether TDOC is a bad investment decision or not, it‚Äôs about how able you are to hold through times like these. If you can‚Äôt hold your investments through recessions (or whatever this is), you have no hope of making $$$$ on the stock market, whether you‚Äôre in index funds or ARKK or penny stocks. Making bad calls on stocks, that‚Äôs a whole other animal‚Ä¶ but if you can‚Äôt hold your ‚Äúbad calls‚Äù when the entire market is taking a dump, it doesn‚Äôt matter what you bought. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you were smart enough to have picked up TSLA in 2013 if you let your emotions get the better of you and panic-sold it in 2014.   So figure out what you‚Äôre capable of holding in a market that‚Äôs on fire. Maybe that‚Äôs only $1000. Maybe you can only find the balls to hold when it‚Äôs index funds rather than ARKK shit you picked yourself. Whatever it is, stick to it, because if you can‚Äôt hold what you‚Äôve got in the market now, in the market, and you pull out now, you should NOT put that $ back into the market (at least in the way you put it in- maybe it‚Äôs index funds from now on, but don‚Äôt for the love of God don‚Äôt sell your TDOC only to buy DKNG a couple months later).](/r/stocks/comments/usirac/this_market_is_really_taking_a_toll_on_me/i93qq19/)

[&gt; At this point I have no idea what would actually trigger a TSLA crash.  The problem is threefold:  1. Tesla has a great product, long order backlog, and great margins (Tesla can sell as many cars as they can produce @ healthy margins) 2. They just finished building two new factories to more than double production over the next few years  3. If you project out what Tesla's P/E ratio will be in two/three years at today's stock price, it's lower than Apple, MSFT, etc.  Lots of people can do math.  They're going to buy shares if it goes much lower than today's price.  Re, the inevitable ""but the competition"":  Yea, so what?  Tesla has patents out the wazoo.  You literally can't build a car that roadtrips as well as a Model 3 without paying the piper.

[I‚Äôm going to disagree. There is no doubt options can have enormous downside (and upside) potential. The problem with them isn‚Äôt that they go up or down (stocks do the same thing), it‚Äôs that they have a time component, and people just truly do not understand that linear changes in the underlying result in exponential changes in options pricing and can be amplified with a time component. A calculus class would be my suggestion to someone trying to understand options.  0 DTE SPY options are gambling. No doubt. But is it REALLY gambling if you bought $440 SPY calls with a January expiration when SPY hit $429 in September? You can surely argue there was a risk component, but we all kind of knew what was going to happen. Is it really gambling if you bought puts on shitty SPACs that all cratered after merger this summer? Is it REALLY gambling when AFRM signed the deal with AMZN just before their earnings what the price action would be? I did all three of those things this year and made amazing returns.  So my argument would be that when pricing becomes somewhat predictable, options are not a bad play. Is it gambling? It absolutely can be, and if you don‚Äôt understand WTF you‚Äôre doing, you‚Äôre playing with C4 and a detonator. But, not every options play is a Keno board at a casino (which has the worst odds in the building).](/r/stocks/comments/qm38fw/how_to_stop_trading_on_emotions/hj7z9qb/)

"**2021 Diversification beats Arrogance (Journey and commentary)**



As 2021 rolled out I was, as always, cautious. I kept buying good fundamentals and editing my ideal entry price to some tech stocks I have kept an eye on. 


I had used margin to leverage myself 2-4x throughout 2020 and I knew this was risky. Compounding risk by buying risky stocks or leveraged ETFs wouldn't be wise.


I had beaten indexing in 2020 and I made the occasional post laughing at people yelling about risk adjusted returns as if that matters. I had more gains than them and all they could do was yell about how risky it was. These are the kinds of people who would pay off a 1% mortgage because holding VTI is too risky. I would take that money into VTI and say this is not risky enough. Oh there were stories about just holding all TSLA or all [redacted] and this and that but I had made several plays on various stocks including a little TSLA and a little SPWR and I was satisfied. I continue holding gold mining stocks.


I was at times swamped with Earnings Reports and Earnings calls but I knew one thing and one thing only. 


**""You will not predict the future and no one else will, the best gains are made with calculated bets""**


So I kept my diversification going and adjusted (especially on weeks where 20 Earnings Calls happened in 3-4 days) by ranking my picks from safe with 100% conviction on long term vision (50 years) to risky and has to be reviewed regularly. Then I caught up as I had time. By May it was obvious that I had ""missed"" a wonderful GME opportunity and of course I did. Those who had calls going into January 2021 that expired later that year probably had a chance to retire. 


With each wild and irrational swing down I bought the dip and each wild irrational swing up I sold off some of my positions. I was leveraged so naturally I was holding far more in every stock than I could without that leverage, it was rewarding. When I wanted to take a few weeks off in the summer I did. Most weekends I do a blackout on finances and economics on Friday Close and only take a disinterested glance on Sunday evenings.



When politics caused some of my picks to shoot up 10-20% in a week I sold off until I was just holding my long term positions as if I wasn't leveraged. With this market the volatility nearly always allows a lower entry later. Sometimes a week later. Remember I am leveraged so short term profit taking is necessary to take full advantage of what the risk affords me.



When the market sometimes judged a guidance or a short term supply issue as a reason to sell off a stock, I reviewed the fundamentals and bought more. I am not holding stocks that don't have a great long term business model that works today, not just in theory.



By October I had decided my appetite for risk had been fulfilled and I needed to deleverage. sold off what I could and by early November I was less leveraged than I had been since April 2020. I saw the corrections and entered some tech positions that I found at comfortable prices. You know what happened next, the dip kept dipping. 


Entering 2022 I am still up on most of my positions. I have compounded gains due to the way I approached risk. I have removed some stocks from my watchlists that have been unable to adjust to our new economic reality in 2021 and their debt has expanded while their earnings have not done so well adjusted for inflation since 2019.


**TLDR** So here I am. 'The crash is coming'. I have beat indexes. I am diversified. I have managed my risk level in a way I find comfortable. I will do it all over again this year. Some will panick or play into some wild conspiracy theories while the wise will take their money and nod.",positive

"Oh, I'm going to say first that I appreciate the amount of effort that went in here, but maybe you're barking up the wrong tree.  I understand that many people are making their statements based on no real evidence, and those folks have a variety of attitudes toward TSLA.

That's not the case for me; most of my exposition here came in a real-money investment context, though an educational one. That all is to say that, I appreciate the effort, but you haven't made an argument that's new to me, or presented numbers that are new to me. But I'm glad there are people on the other side of the trade still! Good luck, and thanks again.",positive
"Im part of a discord that's taught me a lot of different strategies and TA. There's YouTube channels that you can use and books that teach the basics, but I paid for a mentorship to learn TA and options strategies. Honestly, the TSLA 0DTE strategy is high risk, so it's not really a ""mitigated risk"" strategy, but it works out haha. I would only risk 2% of your port Max on those type of plays.",positive

Look at TSLA, what crazy bananas would buy at that level? Yes, yes InSTiTuTiOns HaVe MoNiEs, but seriously? $1 trillion? a fucking barely(this is also questionable) profitable electric car company? Or is it just a humongous cash dumpster since literally every fund worth their salt has their hands in this particular cookie jar..?

[Oh don‚Äôt feel bad, I‚Äôve pulled many dumb trades.   Especially this year trying out what I call Reddit Tactics. I think it was what, around Feb when ZM hit 450ish, I bought 600 or 660c‚Äôs with 3-4DTE RIGHT AT THE TOP, very tippy top. Trying to get in on those YOLO plays we see on here all the time- which is not my kind of trading. I‚Äôm super conservative, stick mainly to options on indices funds. I lost it all. I had sold very good (fundamentally) stock and let go of ITM leaps, deeply ITM just to make the play. Next three or 4 days until expiry it fell everyday, ZM did. I lost it all, had under 300 in my buying power. Took a break until late Spring and first purchase was a 12c on AMC months out, made 10k on it in June.  Ever since then I have not traded outside of SPY, AAPL, and a couple of puts on HOOD and SPCE. Scared the shit out of me.

TECK is 3rd largest holding in COPX, and this is part of why I'm in TECK and FCX

David Einhorn Sees A Gold Rush In Copper Due To EVs  
  
David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital presented his thesis for Teck Resources at the recent 2021 Sohn Investment Conference. He explained that the vast amount of electricity needed to support electric vehicles would create a copper rush, giving copper miners like Teck Resources a boost.  
  
Why copper instead of EVs?  
Einhorn sees electric vehicles (EVs) as a gold rush right now and noted that many investors are diving into the sector. However, he takes a different tactic to the trend. All those EVs will need a lot of electricity, including wind and solar power and chargers. They will need electricity storage and generation.  
  
Although the Greenlight Chief has been critical of Tesla TSLA  CEO Elon Musk in the past, he called attention to something Musk said on the automaker's earnings call in April. Einhorn believes the world will need roughly twice as much electricity as it has now if all transport goes electric and three times as much electricity if all heating goes electric.  
  
David notes that it's impossible to know the winners or losers in the EV race, so many investors are diving into all or any of them. Further, he believes the multiples EV makers are trading at seems ambitious to investors like him who try to tie companies' values to their future cash flows. Thus, he looks at copper as an alternative EV play.  
  
Why copper is an EV play  
Electric vehicles have four times more copper than vehicles that run on internal combustion engines. Batteries and chargers require a lot of copper, and wind and solar power generation require tons of copper. Copper is used for its electric and thermal conductivity and corrosion resistance. As a side note, bitcoin mining also requires a lot of electricity, which uses copper.  
  
The Greenlight chief calls attention to a recent Goldman Sachs report in which the firm said copper is the new oil. Based on supply and demand for copper, he said green electrification would require another 5 million metric tons of copper by 2029.  
  
Why copper stocks should be winners  
Although EV stocks have skyrocketed, material stocks had done terribly. Capital in the sector is scarce, which has reduced the new project development pipeline down more than 60% of capacity since 2008.  
  
He explained that it takes three years to expand an existing mine and eight years to start a new one. Without much higher prices to incentivize investment, supply will likely fall well below demand by 2024. The supply gap will lead to higher copper prices. Goldman estimated $6.80 a pound in 2025, and copper prices have already more than doubled from last year's low.  
  
Higher prices force industries to find other solutions, so Einhorn expects more scrap copper and notes that some could look to aluminum as a replacement. However, aluminum is an inferior replacement in decarbonization efforts because it will be hurt more by any potential carbon tax. Additionally, aluminum prices are up 22% this year, so any substitution will likely be further down the road instead of right now.  
  
Freeport McMoRan  
To get into copper, Einhorn looked at a pair of copper miners. Freeport McMoRan shares are up 45% this year but still trading at what he calls a ""reasonable"" 16 times 2021 earnings. It's a pure-play on the copper price, but in 2025, the company estimates 10% less production than this year and 25% less than in 2016. The mining industry has been challenging over the last decade, making the most significant players reluctant to add capacity.  
  
Freeport CEO Richard Adkerson said the price of copper could double overnight, but they couldn't add significant production for several years.  
  
Teck Resources  
Einhorn likes Teck Resources more than Freeport for several reasons. He describes it as an overlooked Canadian miner. Teck's Class B shares are listed in Toronto and on the New York Stock Exchange. The company trades at two-thirds of Freeport's PE multiple and has much better growth prospects. Teck shares had done well this year but underperformed Freeport.  
  
Teck is more of a diversified miner, as it produces metallurgical coal, zinc and copper. Unlike Freeport, Teck is undergoing a significant copper mining expansion project in Chile, and it owns half of that project, called QB2, which will come online in the second half of next year.  
  
Teck underwrote the project at a copper price of $3 per pound, but David says the forward price is around $4.50, so the returns will be better than initially expected. If holding to Goldman's bull case for copper at $6.80 per pound, the expansion project itself would be worth Teck's entire market capitalization even though it won't contribute to the company's bottom line until 2023.  
  
Why Einhorn likes Teck  
The new project will reshape Teck's business toward copper, and the company has five other copper projects it wants to either sell or partner with someone else who wants to put in capital to develop them.  
  
Management estimated the value of those projects at C$3 billion in 2017 when copper was at $2.70 per pound. After QB2, Teck will expand further with QB3, which will come online in 2030 and double QB2's production capacity, making it a top-five copper mine globally.  
  
Metallurgical coal is currently Teck's largest product today. Analysts expect the supply and demand to remain balanced, but Einhorn believes it could fall into a deficit in the near term. Met coal is different from thermal coal, which is being targeted for its carbon emissions. However, there is no substitute for met coal, which means that we have to burn met coal if we want steel.  
  
Like most commodities, met coal has also increased this year, rising to $175 per metric ton, although most analysts estimate $150 per ton. Met coal has gone through supply-driven shortages in the past, like when flooding in Queensland drove prices above $300 a ton in 2010. If the commodity went to $300 again, Teck would generate over $1 billion of incremental EBITDA per quarter.  
  
Analyzing Teck's earnings  
Teck earned 61 cents per share in the first quarter; it is forecast to earn $3.23 per share for the entire year at the current copper curve and with met coal at $150 per ton. The company trades at 9.6 times 2021 earnings, and he expects it to beat consensus, which hasn't adjusted to recent commodity prices.  
  
When QB2 comes online, he expects upside earnings surprises. Teck could report earnings of $4.40 per share in 2023. David expects depreciation to exceed capital spending, resulting in higher free cash flow per share so that the company could trade at 4.6 times cash flow at $4.50 per pound of copper. Teck doesn't have any debt coming due until 2030, and management has said that when QB2 comes online, they will return their free cash flow to shareholders.  
  
With $3 copper, which was the price before the recent commodity run, Teck shares are worth C$40, and with C$4.50 copper, 

**Einhorn sees them as worth $59**.

"I disagree.

At this point in time, no conclusions can realistically be drawn. Tsla fans would be wrong to claim tsla is the de facto leader, and the anti tsla crowd would also be wrong to claim they are last. Nobody knows the best pathway to autonomy yet. All opinions and hearsay until someone solves it. Period.

 Looking at other autonomy solutions is a red herring right now. They all operate in tiny geofenced areas that are heavily mapped. If tsla geofenced it‚Äôs autonomy in the same little corner of phoenix, I suspect their performance would be similar to Waymo. Simply incomparable at this time given the divergent solutions being pursued. 

Full transparency, I‚Äôm a tsla bull. Big if, but if tsla can successfully pull off their vision of autonomy, their share price will explode upwards. Their solution would allow for them to instantly saturate the autonomy market and their cost profile would immediately kill the other autonomy solutions. Again, far from guaranteed.

"It took a lot of self reflection and just being really honest with myself about what was happening and defining my goals.  I only trade options and so I began going over my plays and it wasn't until then that I realized, even on winning trades that mistakes were being made all over the place.  

I had become my own worst enemy.  I was able to plug some leaks pretty quickly and also started to focus on trading psychology.  I shrunk my list down again and looked at it from an IV perspective and started making a watchlist with low IV.  The smaller lists were helping but it wasn't enough as I was still making now different mistakes and then getting frustrated, going back to old habits and doing my head in.  More reflection and a new list that was even smaller but intraday movements.  

I was making progress but it wasn't until I started focussing on liquidity was where I saw the biggest changes.  The two tickers I have played this year have been TSLA and SPY.  I now shift my focus directly on the spy.  I also keep an eye on the sector ETF's to be able to help with decision making and then just a few weighted tickers within the top sectors like AAPL for example.  

After shifting my focus to liquidity I was able to plan out trades before I was making them.  Familiarization helps a lot because I can calculate what I need from it and how I can get it.  

My decision fatigue has gone away because I am so much more prepared and my trading has organically gotten better throughout the journey.

So I can either sell the contract to someone else (currently at 38% gain) or ‚Äúexercise‚Äù the call and buy shares for 220 if the price booms and goes past that price this week.

[I actually disagree here.  Do I think TSLA is overpriced?  Yeah on current fundamentals.  But I think good EV competition is **good** for Tesla because it proves they were RIGHT - it's actually a confirmation of the bull case.  More EVs on the market will bring more EV infrastructure (in which Tesla is currently #1) and more opportunity for wider implementation and acceptance.  For example, I could see some Interstates being retrofitted with wireless charging pads in the asphalt so your EV actually charges while you drive.  Imagine if Ford, GM, and other big brands all jumped on the bandwagon here... and what that could do for Tesla's long-haul truck aspirations (on top of their popular cars).  Imagine having AI-only lanes (like HOV) where the cars could drive within a few feet from each other at high speeds because they are centralized on a network and able to respond to dangers miles ahead (much further than human eyes).  Tesla is certainly pushing some regulatory borders here, but their Autopilot with navigation is by far some of the most advanced tech currently (widely) available.  Of course it still needs more work, but again, competition actually helps Tesla here because it will bring about more market acceptance and regulatory approval.  If Tesla were the only major player in the EV market, there's no way municipalities would take on expensive infrastructure builds to accommodate EVs.  But with so many companies committing to EV strategy, I think it's only natural that these imaginative ideas start making their way into mainstream conversation and, one day, building plans.  Yes, I think Tesla's valuation is incredibly optimistic.  But if the bear case is that some Mach-E sales are going to put a dent in Tesla sales, I think people are vastly underestimating the wave of change that Tesla is pushing and seemingly winning.](/r/StockMarket/comments/qfngrp/take_a_look_at_this_chart_of_tesla_since_2020_to/hi2d4jr/)

[The fact that Hertz CEO, Mark Fields (former Ford CEO), chose to pay full price and willing to wait 14 months for Tesla speak volumes.   Hertz could easily split the order to like 50k Tesla, 25K Mach E and 25k ID4. They could get huge discounts but chose not to buy from Ford, VW or GM. Hertz did their deligience that not only Tesla is a huge draw, but the total cost of ownership is lower than all the legacy EV.   But at the same time, if any customer renting a Mach E is stuck in the middle of nowhere because Electrify America chargers broke down, they would not rent from Hertz again. Tesla's supercharger network is a huge moat and any other rental companies buying non-Tesla EV will have to face.   While Tesla is supply constrained for years to come, putting many more drivers who get to drive Tesla for the first time will just light the fire on more demands for Model 3, Y and Cybertruck. Very few people who drive a Model 3 will think about buying Camry as their next car.   TLDR. Competition is not coming, unless you think you know more about car business than Mark Fields.](/r/stocks/comments/qfhkpl/hertz_plans_to_buy_100000_tesla_vehicles/hhzney3/)

They are too far behind and have to convert a whole dying ICE business in the process.  Tesla also has AI and Solar to grow and expand into other possible revenue streams as well.

"&gt;I would anyday take small electronic niggles and QC issues over having a blown up transmission.

Never happened with me. You're behaving like as if every VW owner has had this issue, while the truth is every VW owner who has ever reported having this issue has had this issue. And that number has got to be very, very low. Such issues happen with Apple products too.

&gt;None of the vehicles you stated above managed to make a dent in our market except the Polo which too was negligible.

I'm not sure if this will ever be the case, just like how Audi, BMV won't make a dent in our market. These cars exist for a very small number of buyers who are willing to pay a premium for quality cars, and it's never going to attract the masses.

&gt;thats the real competition for the Germans and the Americans and they have so far lost to the Japanese, Koreans and even Indians in the last 15 years.

Again, that's like saying that Apple has lost in India because they aren't selling as many phones or laptops as other brands.

"For those worried about a recession https://youtu.be/u2o_tix0PbI great advice in the first few minutes in the case that this does happen in 2008 Apple lost more than half its value but then fully recovered within a year to go onto 75x in following years. Also see this video by Tom Nash https://youtu.be/I1nMuaMydfo that perfectly sums up all the reasons TSLA is the best place to have your money during a recession.

TSLA is recession proof. They have piles of cash and excellent cash flow. Industry leading profit  -  all growing exponentially. Higher interest rates will not affect the fundamentals. In fact in some ways a recession could play into their hands as will hasten demise of debt riddled, low margin legacy auto that is  being forced to cannibalise itself just to survive.

"A candle is a series of trades - each with their own particular price.  The first trade in the candle sets the open, the last the close.  The high is the max price the security traded at during the candle whereas the low is the min price. Volume is the sum of all trades occurring during the candle. No trades? then no candle can be created... 1 trade? then a candle with the Open=high=low=close will be created with the volume of the trade.

Gaps during regular trading hours are periods of no trades. Gaps during extended hours/sessions are also periods of no trades - and are more likely to happen due to reduced market participation and/or lack of exchanges trading the security.   Options - especially those that are OTM - are notorious for long periods of no trades. Some charting apps such as TOS, allow you to chart the option or a low priced stock using the mid point between the bid and ask prices to get a feel of where the option/stock might trade when no trades are occurring.

Gaps may be created by your data feed - particularly if it's free as these feeds do not combine the trades occurring multiple exchange. TV's free trade feed only covers trades on the CBOE exchange and has really bad market participation after regular trading hours--&gt; thus large gaps. Crypto products are another good example of this... most exchanges only report their OWN trades and bids... eg exchange A may be priced with a bid/ask of 4.10x 4.50 and  have no trades whereas exchange B might be 4.20 x 4.40, and have 100's of trades.

You always sell at the bid (max price a buyer is willing to pay) and buy at the ask (min price which seller is willing to sell) when you do a market order. Although some brokers may try get you a price between these the bid and ask, others go out and get a better price and then turn around and sell you the security -  front running your order and pocketing the difference. Still others will farm out your order to a hedge fund in exchange for a payment for order flow and let the hedge fund fulfill your order.  

If you do a limit order, you can split the ""spread"" or difference between the bid and ask and attempt to narrow the spread... eg the bid/ask might be 4.20 x 4.40 but lets say you want to buy and put in limit order to buy shares at 4.30, assuming no other changes, the bid/ask spread will become 4.30 x 4.40 and you'll get filled if one of the sellers really wants out and is willing to take the trade at your 4.30 price point.

The reverse is also true - if you really really want to get out of a stock, you can offer to accept less than the current ask price.. eg you drop the market from 4.40 to 4.30 and will get rid of your stock only if there's a buyer willing to pay more than the going rate of 4.20 to get the stock.

You can think of the spread as a measurement of the market participation.  Wider the spread, the fewer people are participating in trading the stock, resulting in less ease of getting in and out of the stock, and the more traders want to be paid in case reverse the trade.  Vis versa, the narrower the spread, the more people are participating.  Popular stocks such as the SPY ETF have a spreads measured in pennies. Low volume, no name stocks appearing on the OTC Pink sheets might have a spread of 50 cents to as much as several dollars.  Price of the stock also affects the spread - a $2 stock will generally have a narrower spread that a high priced stock such as TSLA.

Spend some time researching the investopedia, and watching the bid/ask spreads on various type of stocks to get a better understanding of how the market prices the stocks.  In all cases, the buyers and sellers are participating in a market where they control what stocks they trade in and at what price they buy and sell.  If  they're choosing to trade stocks with wide bid/ask spreads, using market orders, then the market is very efficient... and quickly extracts extra money from the trader's pockets.... :-)",positive

"1. Options with some undetermined positive value, +2k cash. Regulatory margin active. Everything is great.
2. Long call with some undetermined value.  
 \-100 position in TSLA. Using your strike of 900... we can assume that the TSLA price must be at least 901.   
\-100 TSLA at 901: -90,100 contribution to NAV. You receive 90k for the sale. 2k starting, so new NAV: 1900. You are now in breach of regulatory requirements for margin. Note that this only gets worse as the gap widens.   
At this point, you don't actually have a spread anymore. Your risk profile is short stock + long option. At my broker IBKR, this is treated as a protective call, which carries a margin requirement equal whatever your margin value is for holding short stock. At this guys level, it's likely 50% (45k) or get liquidated. 
3. Broker is allowed to deal with this breach in any way that they please. YOU can't exercise the long call for 70k. You don't have anywhere close to the amount of assets to do it yourself, since you barely have enough to keep your short option until end of day. People do not just float you -100 blocks of shares on good faith, even at places as ass-backwards as TDA.   


The broker could exercise the long call on your behalf. But they are under no obligation to do so. They might, but they also might just sell it.  By falling under the margin requirements, you broke the rules. Whether they want to good faith move around 160k worth of assets in your favor (good guys) or just liquidate you and say ""gee whiz, what a shame"" (bad guys), they set the rules. And it's often at their discretion and nearly always at the worst possible execution price to get that shit off their books ASAP.

For instance  page 25-26:   &gt;In seeking to answer this question, staff observed that during some discrete periods, GME had sharp price increases concurrently with **known major short sellers covering their short positions after incurring significant losses**. During these times, **short sellers covering their positions** likely contributed to increases in GME‚Äôs price. For example, staff observed that particularly during the earlier rise from January 22 to 27 **the price of GME rose as the short interest decreased**. Staff also observed discrete periods of sharp price increases during which **accounts held by firms known to the staff to be covering short interest in GME were actively buying large volumes of GME shares**, in some cases accounting for very significant portions of the net buying pressure during a period.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tumdex/deep_dive_into_the_market_cycle_and_how_it/i35n2nr/)

[The partnership is for GME to try to sell more Microsoft hardware lol. GME had a long standing agreement where they would get a small percentage of the money spent within the Microsoft environment for XBOX consoles GME sold, for example. But those agreements only made sense when there was a need for someone to push and market XBOX consoles. That need is dropping as console makers like Microsoft slowly buy up gaming studios directly and shift over to direct to consumer sales cutting out the middlemen. If you think they are going to let middlemen in for NFT sales or other I think you're naive. And that is a very competitive area with lots of real tech companies fighting for the same business.   Of course I can't predict the future. Who could predict the $20-&gt;$500 bull run? But smart money is on trading GME both up and down. And hoping you don't get stuck holding the bag.

[Your statement is completely untrue. Short sellers can not put a good company out of business. Their stock has nothing to do with a stocks bottom line.  BB went out of business for many reasons and the main was is not changing with the times. Also they made a huge amount of money on late fees. Netflix comes along and no late fees AND the convenience of DVD being mailed to your home. Netflix ABSOLUTELY changed the market for blockbuster and they did not change their business model. So they lost. But i am baffled at how anyone can possibly think that short selling can affect a business. It doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Stocks have no direct impact on business performance. Nor does the business profit or lose from their stock performance. The only thing is CEO get bonuses based on stock performance. But again does not affect a business. If their stock is crap they will delist. Again does not affect the bottom line. If blockbuster was a strong company than there would be institutional demand and the stock would ebb and flow like all others.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/swo7dn/here_is_why_netflix_is_a_dumb_fuck_company_with/hxoe60p/)

[Many pop once and gone next after losing usefulness. Most use Reddit to show that was discussed based on frequency distribution of mentioning last 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month etc. But there should be lots and lots of sources to make it worth awhile.  What has not explored is the mentioning is one thing. The worthness of stats has a disconnect with reality.  If one looks at ipo stocks majority tank quickly within 3 months. All over valued , overissued  for their potential with no sales data.  Most do not produce a profit even after several years.  Having information on GME, AMC do not help people to be rich.  The one that was artificially promoted had tons of positive news, DD showing how strong a new mortage company named Quicken was. Reddit must had a few dedicated paid promoters who said RKT stock was the best investment of the century.  These promoters are out there downvote and challenge anyone who does not agree. After rise to $41 same people claim it would be $100 or 200/s.  After a dump at $41 it has been falling and falling to where it should have been.  I add social media ratio as additional parameter to seek or sort public stocks. I have not seen much use.  Right now, it shows Loews, PLTR as most mentioned.

Not to mention that the luxury EV market is not nearly as untargeted as a lot of LCID bulls would like to believe. The model S is by no means an economy car for instance and has been a long standing foothold for TSLA in the luxury EV segment. Not to mention much more well established luxury brands like Porsche already has a position in that segment with it's Taycan and Mercedes is already public about plans to release their own luxury EV. So even in that segment they're entering a competitive space with big names already having a foothold.

In short I think LCID will struggle unless they come out with a game changer or their product performs significantly better than it's competitions, which is already hard to see with it being arguably less equipped than the model S at a similar price point.",positive

"here are my thoughts on OTM puts.  
1.  if you looks OTM Puts creation dates, they match exactly on below two rules.

a. OTM Puts were created on dates when they run out of borrowed shares

b. otm puts were created only on dates, when they do ladder attack/large price decline  


2. all the itm puts are created 1-2-3 days before the price tank only. looks like whales or insiders or HF. to maximize profits   


3. for OTM puts of feb, march yes they covered using C35 rules, that was price hike in feb, march. they dont need to covert the shorts on the last C35 days, they can cover it any day before those dates.

4. where did the OTM puts of april 16 goes : part of it covered by 3.5M ATM and rest is covered by June Hike  


5. so far looks like all the major otm puts are covered after their expiry, not on exact C35 but on or before those dates.  


6. to boost my point of 1.a, i had seen very recently they started deep OTM puts on AMC as well, same reason whey they run out of borrowed share and they needs to tank price, they create naked and to avoid naked being names as FTD, they married those naked to deep otm married puts.

  
7.  more example of point (1.a) sep 15, 2020 check out tsla deep otm, and check their creation date, exactly align with same thinking,  they need to tank price, but out of borrowed share, hence created naked and bind to married puts.",positive

RKLB‚Äôs playbook has been pretty straightforward. Their PR style has been consistent since before the merger and hasn‚Äôt changed. Their order book is the same as it was, plus a little growth at a rate in keeping with their forecasts and history.

"I agree that RIVN is a real business not at all like NKLA. But even at $20B, I think it‚Äôs worth too much. The auto market is saturated, and the EV market is getting much more saturated (even excluding the multitude of deSPACd scam companies) with the legacy players jumping in and obviously TSLA. I wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable owning RIVN until it‚Äôs on the road toward huge sales and generating positive FCF. It‚Äôs just too speculative for me at this point. 

In 2020/2021, it may have made sense to ignore valuation, but that‚Äôs not the case any more and really shouldn‚Äôt have ever been, so I won‚Äôt touch it until it either drops  90% from here or has billions in earnings, making it comparable to legacy autos. At the end of the day, these are auto companies and auto companies aren‚Äôt that sexy (with low operating leverage and high capex even when performing strong), even if they have a battery.

Edit: when I made the comment, I ignored the fact that the company has $18B in cash on its BS. The company should at least reflect this value as a floor price more or less. However, just having cash does not mean you are going to get a good return as on an investment as they can burn through it inefficiently, so if the company does not produce significant ROE, it should trade at a discount even to the cash, but if it really does pickup steam and grows efficiently, that cash can be deployed and lead to great results (I‚Äôm still staying out).",positive

I've been basically letting my money sit and reduce in value so I finally got my ass off after seeing the meta price crash, and talked with a few friends who've been investing for a couple years now. They said it's a really good time to buy because a lot of the prices have come down. Created an account with a brokerage just about a month ago. Trying to invest about $1k-ish per company, except for GOOG and AMZN because of the news about stock splits. Got a share of each. My core is mostly tech since I'm a tech guy myself, but I'm trying to invest in ETFs too. So far, I've lost about 3-4%, but I've always read ""Time in the market is better than timing the market"", so I'm trying not to lose heart and trying to invest in sound companies.

[There are no safe mid to long term investment. What seems safe now may not seems safe in the future, what you see in the future is the key to your investment.   INTC used to be the most popular chip maker for pc, and pc sales dominate for a while, and AMD was not so good back then. MSFT used to be the main OS, now IOS and Android, Hence APPL and GOOG.  You have to come across a lot of products/services (I see some of the new ones, such online insurance sales LMND, online car dealer CVNA, differ from traditional ones which still need to pass some hurdles) for years to see if they can dominate the market, what is in the baby phrase now, could be the next big thing, and all you have to do is invest even fractional into them.  What seems risky now could be the stable players in the market. If you can't take the risk, go with VTI, which is the US market fund that contains all US stocks. If you don't believe in the US economy,  I don't know what you believe in.  Choose what you believe in, is much safer than suggestions from others. If you take the fall or get the gains from your own pick, it is all your merit, to buy, to hold for a time frame, and to sell, these don't depend on anyone since no one is of the same life/financial situation as yours.  There are tons of niche market getting to be the main player, please research and decide to invest in them.  I am into the VR and AR sector and all components related to it, be it networking or parts chipmakers, example LITE, IIVI, HIMX, FN, NPTN, VUZI, KOPN, IMMR, NTNX to name a few.

[If you can't bear the thought of working until 60 years old now, what are your plans if your investments are wiped out and have to work until 70 years old?  Your formula for risky investments should be:Life expectancy = L (100? 80? or 70?)Your age = A = 19Percent of risky High growth investments out of your savings = RPercent of inflation protected capital preservation investments = S = AR = (L - A)So, if your L = 100, your R = 81 and S = 19. You should invest $500 \* 81% = $405 in high growth investments (stocks, options, ETFs, or high growth funds) and put $95 into stable investments (bonds, TIPS, risk-balanced funds, etc.). Every 4-5 years, you should adjust the allocation based on your life trajectory.Or you can YOLO and hope your country's welfare system will save you.  And another tip from financial advisors is that you should ""strive to save"" A% of your total income towards retirement until you are 35. So, you should save 19% of total income at this time and go up to 35% over the next decade. Not always possible, but you should ""strive"".  This is not my own advise, I heard these tips at retirement planning presentations, so throwing them your way.

Apple is going to be extremely involved in Augmented Reality, because they have to protect the throne. Right now, mobile computing is king. But in another 15 to 20 years, spatial computing will be king. Phones will morph into sunglasses that we wear on our face.  Facebook and Microsoft are both extremely bullish on AR and they've both spent billions on it. Microsoft has HoloLens already, and they keep refining it. Facebook is working on AR glasses.  Apple has to deal with these threats and protect their leadership position, and I'm sure they're going to have some amazing products coming down the pipe in this regard.

[Would love to hear your thoughts on them seeing how you've researched them. Any DD you'd like to discuss?  Personally, I like CROX and I do have a position in them. The big risk here is of course them going out of trend or not being able to keep up the brilliant management of the past years. There's als their level of debt and the fact that their product might be one to suffer if there's a recession. But then again, CROX has been pronounced dead and a crime against all fashion for a decade+ now, and they managed to really pull it back with their marketing. Their business is somewhat lightweight and it shouldn't be difficult for them to move production if needed, they don't need skilled labor either. Their ROE is exceptional and, as you said, they look dirt cheap on just about any fundamental basis. And them acquiring HeyDude was a good bit of business imo, although arguably upping their buybacks at a valuation they deem low would have been a good choice as well. I still think their course was correct.  As for MU, I had a position in them, don't have one currently but intended to buy back recently if they dropped to the very low 60s, but will probably start around 65ish. They're probably still a decent deal at the current price, but I'm just watching for now. My previous cost basis on them was $63 in late 2020 and I moved that on after the significant run-up.  Haven't taken so much as a single look at COF so I can't add anything here.

Likewise, if your cost basis on TSLA is $170, I'd actually say it's a good buy because even if it comes down to earth that should be a good base and net your above average returns. Same goes for most stocks. But some are trash even if you got them close to their lows.

[Yes I got SHOP, CRSR and TSLA all at pretty good prices. The reason for all the energy is because during the time of the election both Biden and Trump were making promises to do with clean energy and all energy were performing well based on them just saying what they were going to do however nothing has actually happened.

[Well at this point, one could consider comparing the company Tesla to other car companies as an apple to oranges comparison. A funny way to look at it is how many YouTubers and social media influencers are there for each company? Another angle is how are each of the companies getting returned on capital invested? (TSLA is like a mindboggling 20% or somesuch.) How are each of the companies dealing with their looming dead development silos and legacy obligations? Which companies are more like an ETF rather than providing a narrow focus of products? Which CEOs are acknowledging trends that will greatly impact their companies and/or their competitors, and which CEOs are blatantly lying to themselves and others? Which companies are making efforts in securing batteries for their future. For some reason Tesla as a brand has garnered a ginormous amount of slack for all the troubles and problems experienced as a new car company. Without a PR budget or an advertising department. Given their vertical integration and well endowed and broadly focused engineering teams they were able to get around the chip shortage issue and increase production. No other car company that I've seen was able to do that and the chip shortage is going to continue for years ahead in one form or another. Herbert Diess called out a very interesting number. That it takes Volkswagen 30 plus hours to make a car and it takes Tesla like 10+ and two new iteratively developed factories are coming online right now in Texas and Germany.  A fun wrinkle of thought on batteries, if Tesla doesn't have enough batteries then no one has enough batteries.  *Edit: Tesla stock price maybe so astronomical because it has an amazing options chain.](/r/stocks/comments/s11i7k/teslas_in_trouble/hs5mata/)

[If QS isn't a complete scam, they seem to have the better tech/product.   Solid Power seems further away from an actual lithium metal cell to me. it almost seems like they will never have a lithium metal cell, although they still claim its in the roadmap. but they added another battery to their roadmap that isn't a true solid state battery, more just their electrolyte (sulfide) running on a traditional lithium/silicone/graphite anode like normal li-ion cells already do. So, yea it might be better than current li-ion tech, but sort of sounds like a dead end to me, when clearly a lithium metal anode is what is needed to get a significant range increase.   QS has insisted from the very beginning their battery IS a lithium metal anode and the early prototypes have good performance. thats no guarantee they will get a one hundred layer cell operational, but i just feel like if i was going to dump all my money into something as a moon shot, it would be Quantumscape.   There is no way the CEO escapes prosecution if he is lying about them having the secret ceramic separator that enables a true lithium metal cell. if its a lie, then he has lied about it repeatedly to investors on multiple documented occasions and his entire career would be done. So i kind of doubt he's lying. i think they really do have a high performance ceramic separator that took them a long time to come up with and is highly valuable IP.

[Big question here is whether or not the ‚Äúbull trap‚Äù move has much legs before it breaks. It‚Äôs very evident a tech bubble has ‚Äúpopped‚Äù with most high growth stocks down 60-80% over the past 6 months.  We‚Äôve witnessed how much faster and more violent moves are (many believe it‚Äôs due to options wagging the tail) the past 10 years.  Overpriced but decent stocks have been basically pummeled non-stop without relief (SE, SHOP, SQ, NFLX, FB, etc.) in such a short time span. This drawdown is much more merciless than 2001 drawdowns.  Can‚Äôt imagine folks are going to have much conviction knowing the party is ending. Even in great stocks like AAPL, MSFT, HD, DE, UNH, COST, etc. they are overpriced by conventional metrics. Note that the big boys died months after the speculative junk died in the dot com bubble. Also note that in hindsight, the dot com bubble was mostly a large cap bubble - the dot com specific stocks were a side-show to the real carnage in legitimately good and large businesses.  That being said, Nasdaq is completely different from the nasdaq in 2000. We won‚Äôt see a 70%+ drawdown in indexes.

[Ok this is going to be a rant, please be ready.     Should have been obvious when SHOP was overvalued at 1500 this year but they are still incredibly overvalued. Look at the chart. The biggest factor of their increase was covid, everyone shopping online allowed people to make websites and sell their shitty merchandise, gym clothing whatever else by using shopify platforms so their sales went up during covid. You can see the decline in earnings as a result and they are still trading high in regards to expected growth. They will not continue growing, shopify has hit its peak, people will continue using shopify or just create their own e-commerce website using different software (ex. in the sneakerworld shopify sucks and needed to be replaced by better bot-maintenence support software, its just starting).     Shopify hasnt even hit pre-covid levels yet so once it does (400 range) expect it to stay there or continue to decline due to transitions from shopify to other platforms. Remember they have a 80billion market cap and a P/E of 28.5. That is not sustainable. It is so blantantly obvious they are still overvalued and it is so easy for them to drop far more this year or even next months.

"Agree to disagree. That's an increase of roughly 50%. TSLA and NIO were both +/- 10x ers last year. I guess 2020 was the year of the EV stock, which i was lucky to participate in :) 

I think it's most fair to say this is the decade of the EV. Tesla can certainly 10x from here. NIO has that chance too.",positive
"I‚Äôd argue that there‚Äôs a good chance that you don‚Äôt see more records from any of the averages if you think the Nasdaq is done for the year and for a while.

Yes, we have had periods where other things outside of tech have led to the upside this year, but I do not think the Dow/small caps/old economy names can lead if bond yields are going to act like this.

They are holding up a lot better so far compared to what happened around June FOMC where it was first known that the Fed might tighten sooner, but even considering that.

Should note that I don‚Äôt think the Nasdaq is ‚Äúdone for the year and for a while.‚Äù What we‚Äôve seen happen over the past few weeks is similar behavior to the lead up to that 10%+ correction in September of last year, but it‚Äôs doubtful at best that a freaking twitter poll by Elon is going to be what puts in a local top in an entire index. 

But if it does turn out that this is the case, and we don‚Äôt give back too much, I‚Äôve had a good year so I‚Äôm not complaining. 

In the case of today though, I was just a spectator to the TSLA/PYPL carnage. Didn‚Äôt really get hit with my own stuff.",positive
"This is how the market correction is going to go down. This is how the MM will layer it: Because they can't cause massive panic, in order to take it down 20% they will do the following. First, the MEME stocks take the biggest hit bc that fits their narrative and gives CNBC someone to blame. So meme stocks go down 25-50%. Energy and gold will go down 20% because they are always sucker bets. TSLA will take a massive dump of 25%. After that comes Tech goes down  10% bc they have to leave some hope for average investors who already made massive gains. The banks will go down the least because, well, they run the show and they will use the interest rate narrative to feather their nest. BaaS will be the biggest gainers and the new buzzword.",positive

"If you believe in the future of the company, hold. If you no longer believe in the future of the company, sell.

I bought 25 (split adjusted) shares of TSLA at $66 each (split adjusted) in October 2018. Then it went down to $65 (all prices split adjusted) so I bought 25 (all share numbers split adjusted) more shares. By January 2019 it was down to $62 so I bought 25 more shares. Then it went down to $60 so I bought 25 more shares.

So the price had done nothing but go down after I started buying. I decided this stock was going nowhere. So when the price popped up to $61.60 in February 2019 I sold 25 shares at a loss. But then the price dropped to $58.69 and I was really fed up so I sold 50 more shares at a loss. Then the price dropped to $55 and knew for sure TSLA was a loser so on 3/15/2019 I sold the last 25 shares of the 100 shares I had once owned at a loss. I sold at a loss each time but at least I had sold that loser before it dropped any farther.

TSLA closed today at $764.04. If I had held onto those 100 shares that I had paid $6328 for they would be worth $76,404, a 12x gain, but I had sold them at a loss. So if you no longer believe in the company, sell. But if you still believe in the future of the company hold, even if you are currently in the red.",positive

[The market has been cruel in the past 1‚Äì2 years. But I can't tell you how many times I have seen or heard people say they sell after a stock drops 10%. Ridiculous. People need to read Peter Lynch. Bag holding can be okay. IF YOU'RE HOLDING GOOD COMPANIES.  Generally asking ""should I hold onto my losers"" means nothing. Some people are down like -25% on GOOGL and -40% on TGT rn. People here would have you believe you need to sell, take a loss, and get into indexes. Sure you can do that. Is the market right as to why your stock is down? If its P/S is 30 and it has no earnings, then probably. But if it's way undervalued now, you must decide if you have the conviction to buy more. This is the game you're playing now. You have to buy when the stock is down, as long as the company is continuing to do well overall. It will never feel like the right time when it's down, but that's how real money is often made.  Lastly, the advice that unrealized losses are real losses is NOT VALUABLE unless you're an active trader. For example, if I buy a nice winter jacket for $200, and then 6 months later, go out to a beach in the peak of summer and try to sell the jacket to beachgoers, it's highly unlikely anyone will pay me full price.

[ &gt; None of the TV streaming service companies (Disney+) will like that their \#1 competitor also owns the \#1 TV streaming platform  Amazon and Apple both hold significant shares of the market for streaming client systems (although Apple's is way smaller than the constant astroturfing and advertising imply).  Disney won't care. They have the clout to keep deals on their side or make the pipe operator miserable via FTC interference.  &gt; Netflix most likely will have to dilute their shareholders by a significant margin since I expect a hypothetical deal would have to be all-stock.    Whether they pay cash or stock NFLX holders would be paying a premium for ROKU shares and ROKU holders would be paid a premium. That's just how acquisition works.

"OP, the biggest glaring hole here is your bold claims about the CAGR for art and your use of the ""Artprice100"" index.

These are all heavily prone to survivor and selection biases.  You make general statements about ""contemporary art"" but only choose well known artists with known return.  For stocks, it would be the equivalent of saying ""stocks return 20% CAGR if you just ignore all the ones that do poorly.""

Let's look at the Artprice100.  From their website:

&gt; This new scientific index is a new tool in Artprice‚Äôs panoply of proprietary decision-support tools. In effect, the Artprice100¬Æ index represents an unavoidable new benchmark in a financial world constantly searching for new investment opportunities in efficient markets.

Meaningless buzzwords, and they clearly don't know what the word ""scientific"" means.

&gt; The index essentially identifies the 100 top-performing artists at auction over the previous five years who satisfy a key liquidity criterion (at least ten works of comparable quality sold each year). The weight of each artist is proportional to his/her annual auction turnover over the relevant period.

So, ignore all the artists that don't have impressive growth.

&gt; The composition of the index does not change during the year. Therefore, the overall value of the Artprice100¬Æ evolves according to the individual average performances of each artist in the portfolio, adjusted according to his or her weight within the portfolio.

So there is no criteria for shifts in the index?  They just manually add or remove at the end of each year.  This makes it sound more like an active portfolio and less like a passive index.

&gt; in 2000, the artist Pablo Picasso had a 16% weighting in the portfolio.

To compare, the DJIA only has 30 stocks but the largest weight is under 10%.  Even ARKK has 10% TSLA with under 60 holdings.

&gt; In fact, the new index relies on a huge mass of market information (Artprice‚Äôs Big Data) and eliminates possible blind spots that might escape the Index‚Äôs Scientific Council by analysing repeat sales and auction results from all over the planet.  With its intranet connecting it with more than 6,300 Auction Houses, Artprice is the only organisation in the world that can process this data and produce an index based on a highly complex series of calculations.

Again with the buzzwords.  Apparently they are the only company in the world capable of calculating an index in an industry where trades happen quite slowly.

&gt; Over 18 years, the Artprice100¬Æ grew by 360%, generating an average annual return of 8.9%.'

OP, where are you getting your 25 yr CAGR for art from?  Since this index only ran since 2000, and you claim numbers from 1985.  What's the source, the methodology?",positive

[I don't think these are bad stocks. SHOP, PYPL, CRWD and NET will be fine long-term imo. I've actually been buying these recently because I think there is a good chance some of these will do well later this year.  I don't feel like the market has a good narrative around some of the selling currently taking place. Why have stocks like TSLA, AAPL NVDA (which were already expensive) continued to see multiple expansion while smaller growth names have sold off if the market is so concerned about multiples?  Many of the stocks you mentioned at all time highs were very expensive, but most of these are now starting to look quite attractive. I was selling NET when it hit $200 for example, but this last couple of days I've been buying again because now that it's nearing $100 it's starting to approach what I would consider a reasonable valuation again. It could fall a bit further, but relative to other stocks the move makes absolutely no sense. How can a high PE stock like NVDA be barely off its highs while NET has crashed nearly 50% in a month?  I think the worst is over personally and if you're willing to take another 10-20% to the downside I would hold. I suspect many of these stocks will recover quite well later this year, perhaps not to ATHs, but enough that you may regret selling. That's my base case anyway, but it's possible the indexes will now sell off too pushing some of these names down even further. The fact so many here are selling small growth names to buy index funds right now though suggests to me this is the dumb money trade.](/r/stocks/comments/rvx9sn/should_i_cut_my_losses_in_growth_stocks_and_dump/hr87duy/)

MRNA is a super risky bet, they've got nothing but the Covid vaccine, and that's likely to dry up over the next year or two. After that it's anyone's guess what happens. They're working on a cancer vaccine and a super flu vaccine, if either work they could print money.   SQ is a good company, but they're struggling to turn a profit on $3b+ quarterly revenue while interest rates are super low. How will they do when interest rates start rising?  CRWD is a great company, one of the best in class, but their P/E is insane and they're unprofitable. Same with NET. They're gonna need years of growth to catch up to their valuations.   Can't speak enough to the rest, I haven't done my own research on them, but I've heard great things about them. ETSY is prob your safest bet but who knows.   The real question OP is how risk tolerant are you? There's a very good chance most will be flat or even down over the next year or two.

IOW, what he says and what he reports on can no longer be relied upon to just be Jack Webb style bundles of facts.  Now he has an audience to keep entertained...to keep satisfied.  Hell - he even takes time in this press release to heap some praise on Elon Musk...why do you think he did that?

\&gt; and all above board

Perhaps...but lets put that strawman in the corner for a minute.  I never said he wasn't ""above board"", did I?  Now that's done, lets connect some dots, shall we.  Here's a quote from Sandy Munro:

***""I cannot begin to tell you how much money I made from Tesla stock! In fact I will! I started with $22k, and sold it for $170k. That was from April 1st of 2020 to early 2021.""***

So he bought an individual stock...and published dozens of videos filled with high praise for Tesla products.  Now lets circle back to my original comment about his status as a youtube influencer:

 *""his opinions should be viewed through that lens""*

If anything, my opinion is understated - he has lost almost all his credibility at this point...especially if you go back to that press release...he's now specializing in EVs...while crowing about raking in profits on TSLA.",positive

[Tesla is a company which applies all they do (from batteries to software) to the production of actual cars (for the automotive division). Therefore, if they sell a lot of cars they are selling a lot of the vertical integration they have. This vertical integration is one of the reasons why the margins are so high.   Plus, Tesla has big economies of scale. This means that beating the estimate causes a more than proportional increase in the profits.   308k is a lot different from 267k. It shows a company able to apply its extremely advanced know-how to the scaling of production, in a way that exceeds expectation on most quarters and that nobody else has been able, for now, to replicate on EVs (cue: the production distance between VW and TSLA is, actually, increasing).](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rueag9/tesla_bears_about_to_move_from_the_endangered_to/hr23l9u/)

"Hi!

I'm cashing in on not being able to take my original travel plans in December (due to outbreaks etc) and instead am taking some well deserved time off. This pack is for domestic car travel, and I'll be staying in a mixture of short term rentals and hotel / motel accomodations, about 4+/- days in each spot. Most of my time will be spent lazing about reading, eating, exploring, and just short easy hikes.

I generally wash my clothes, say, either two days before I leave accommodation (ie. ample time to dry before I move on again), or on the first night I arrive at my accommodation. In the washing machine if there's one available at the place, but also quick handwashes while in the shower, or in a sink, whatever. I prefer more frequent light clothes washing.

I like to pack my bag before I head out to dinner on my last night of staying somewhere, so I can enjoy my last night and morning before leaving with minimal fuss. There's not much to pack anyway, but I feel like it's a good habit to get into. I've been on the one bag tip for over a decade now.

Despite being for car travel, this loadout is pretty airplane travel friendly, once I remove my Gerber Dime multitool and Victorinox SD Classic.

My general attitude is bang for buck. The clothes are travel friendly, but put together from my everyday wear. I'm quite happy with this loadout - I like tweaking it in-between trips and packing it for a trip with purpose in mind. I know I can reduce even further / pack less, but at the weight and volume I'm at, what's another 0.5-1kg either way?

Happy to talk through gear, answer questions, so on and so forth :)

Please bear in mind the time difference when it comes to me replying (GMT +10).

4.5kg / 10lbs is the weight of bag plus contents listed below in total (not including worn / on self items, which are noted accordingly).

I'm 5'7"" / 169cms, 85kg - fairly average build + COVID-era 'extra'

This list is an extension / tweak of my last list, with slightly warmer clothes for cooler settings.

## THE BAG

* Fjallraven Kanken 16L
* I'm not really wearing the bag much, it's more of a bring my stuff between point A to B thing. That said, I find Kankens comfortable enough to wear for longer periods, and I'm aware not everyone feels the same way. I've had this for some years now, and it still looks great. I quite like the cavernous boxiness of it - I feel it makes the full bag space quite usable.
* The packing 'cubes' themselves are from IKEA  ... maybe 5-8 years ago? I've taken them on quite a few trips, and totally still do the trick. I don't think they make these ones anymore, but if I recall correctly they cost me less than $10AUD total.

## CLOTHING
(packed - primarily in 'large' cube)

* 1x Uniqlo Airism t-shirt (black)
* 3x cotton t-shirt (grey, white, striped)
* 1x light denim long sleeve collared shirt
* 1x Nike Tech Pack Ultralight Top (black / grey)
* 1x Nike Aeroloft vest (black)
* 1x TSLA compression leggings (black / grey)
* 1x Decathlon NH100 hiking shorts (grey, kinda like hybrid shorts - high recommend)
* 3x cotton boxer briefs
* 1x Uniqlo Airism boxer briefs (additional to worn listed below)
* 2x anklet footlettes 
* Auscam bucket hat
* Merino beanie (black)
* Bison travel belt
* Havaianas (black)

## CLOTHING
(worn - not part of listed weight)

* H&amp;M nylon cargo pants, skinny fit (dark grey) (I only bought these a few weeks ago, but I quite like them for their versatility - can be dressed up or down, comfy enough to kick around in, have elasticated cuffs so I can pull up to my calves if it gets warm, and are relatively quick to dry)
* Merino t-shirt (black)
* Uniqlo Dry EX UV hoodie (black)
* Uniqlo Airism Boxer Brief
* Salomon TechAmphibian 4
* Shemagh

In short - I'm a layering type, I like lightweight clothing, and keep it capsule vibe with generally neutral colours. I try and keep a good mix of cotton, synthetics, and merino.

## ELECTRONICS / MISC
(mainly in 'medium' cube)

* Pack of travel tissues
* Small pack of wet wipes
* 2x scented tealights (also helps keeps bag smelling nice!)
* BIC Lighter
* Eye mask + earplugs
* 40g sunscreen
* Heymix 20w USB charger (1x USB plus 1x PD port)
* 1m braided USB-C cable
* 12cm braided micro USB cable
* KZ ZSA IEMs
* Comsol 3000mah battery pack
* Amazon Fire TV 4K (new addition - bought this late last year on sale for $50AUD and I think it's perfect for travelling, much less of a handful to manage than my ageing Chromecast mk1)
* Set of small Muji utensils
* Kindle 
* Spare AA, AAA batteries
* Anbernic RG350M 64gb w. 256gb microSD
* Motorola G30 128gb w. 256g microSD

## TOILETRIES
(in 'small' pencil case-ish 'cube')

* Bamboo toothbrush
* Travel sized tooth paste
* Tweezers
* BIC Shaver plus extra head
* Comb
* Muji 4.8ml atomiser with cologne
* Muji (6ml?) squeeze container with The Ordinary Squalane
* Muji squeeze container with eucalyptus oil
* Muji squeeze container with coconut oil
* Muji PP cream container with hair product
* Bandaids, painkillers, antihistamines, cotton earbuds in Muji PP case S
* 1/6 bar of Dr. Bronner's, wrapped in baking paper
* Zum Buk Cherry lip balm
* Vintage Elastoplast simple FAK (containing not vintage compression bandage, alcohol wipes, cotton earbuds, band aids, island dressings, paracetamol, antihistamines, ibuprofen etc - separate container from the rest of toiletries, lives in the front pocket of the bag, and take it with me when I go on hikes)

## MISCELLANEOUS

* Packable IKEA shopping bag
* Kathmandu stuff sack (I stick the towel and athletic clothes in this just to keep organised)
* Plastic shopping bag (to separate dirty clothes from clean clothes, if I have dirty clothes I need to pack away)
* Superdry satchel (I bought this for $5 at some outlet store, generally packed away in the bag, handy for just strolling around for the day, and big enough to fit sub-11"" devices like an iPad or Lenovo Duet if I needed to take one ... which I don't, for this trip)
* Turkish towel (I always like travelling with my own towel, and have been flitting again between this and microfibre towels lately)
* Hand sanitiser spray (because 2022, and also works well for deodorising shoes, bag, rooms etc)
* Sunglasses
* Leather notebook holder with notebooks, spare cash, plus Mi signing pen (I like taking notes, writing, and sketching when I travel)
* Sistema 280ml slim flask (not pictured, was sitting on the dish drying rack)
* Various snacks, tea and coffee sachets
* Reusable sandwich bag
* Spare cotton mask
* 2x spare disposable masks, black
* Muji umbrella (I lost my trusty Kathmandu travel umbrella which I've had for about ten years a few weeks ago on public transport - very sad)

## 'EDC' / IN POCKETS
(not pictured, not part of weight)

I've recently posted my EDC over on r/EDC here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/EDC/comments/tcs14n/i_prefer_juice_with_pulp/


- Barkley's tin for my bad habits
- Bic Lighter (I generally prefer the mini, but I occasionally lose it)
- EOS 1R2
- Crucifix and Lady of Fatima charm (I'm no longer religious, so to speak, but grew up religious, so this is more of a nod to my family)
- Victorinox Mango Tango SD Classic
- Chessex d20, because I'm unashamedly a dork
- Muji gel pen (bargain reliability)
- car keys
- Gerber Dime (I flick between this and Leatherman Style PS) with reflective paracord
- Seiko 5 SNK809 on black NATO (with an added hair tie)
- Mi Wireless Earbuds 2
- DAX v2 wallet

Forgot to add my cotton mask in that pic! I'm still being extra careful when out in public / in crowds.

"I own 2 of those stocks. I bought a ton of $F at $10. I will probably buy more if it dips below $12.50. I have $INTL and might buy more if it dips a bit more, but I think it's probably bottomed.

I'm more interested in buying more $GM. I like Ford's future, but I see GM as having much more upside. The price might continue to drop to or below $45 per share which would be a bargain.

"Everything else aside, isn't it possible TSLA fell because a whole lot of Elon die-hards sold a bunch of TSLA, and bought a bunch of TWTR?

I mean, think how much TSLA would drop if SpaceX went public, purely as a result of Elon fans ""diversifying their Elon bets"". Up until now, ~~SpaceX~~ Tesla has been the only way to ""buy Elon stock"". Now there are two ways.

Seems odd to ignore this demand. 

Edit:

1. Yes, the market also fell \~3%. But TSLA dropped 12%. That's a pretty huge difference. A better possible objection would be that TWTR didn't obviously benefit proportionally from the TSLA plunge
2. Yes, Twitter is going private. But that's weeks or months away, and TWTR still hasn't reached its acquisition price (because of uncertainty about whether the deal will go through). Also, TSLA holders aren't necessarily the most rational market participants.",positive

"I keep thinking it's weird that people question Peter's credibility when he was hand picked and interviewed by Elon. If they believe in Elon's decision making then it seems like a moot point to me. 

For the interior and exterior, I kind of feel the same. It is a bit lifeless when viewing it on the screen compared to the other flashy cars like EQS. Even with the Tesla reveal, I was more excited by that than the UI reveal from Lucid.  However, these cars may look interesting but thinking about it may seem overwhelming when actually driving (watch Jay Leno ride in an EQS and notice how he keeps making sly comments about how much is in the car and that it seems like TOO much). So maybe it comes off as simple but may work amazingly from a functional perspective. That's yet to be fully seen or experienced by others not pushing the Lucid narrative.

I disagree with the self driving piece. They're not entering as far behind as one would think since companies like Intel are selling all their training data. But overall fully autonomous driving is years away for everyone (expect monorails üò¨)

Range, Power, Interior and UI are the differentiators between TSLA and LCID (via Lucid narrative).

The EV market seems saturated yet there are still more ICE than EV cars out there. Plus remember it's Lucid Group not just Lucid Motors, so as Peter mentioned as the world move towards electrification (which banks are making commitments to divest from carbon heavy companies by 2030) there is more incentive for companies to use their tech and for consumers to buy their products.",positive

"TSLA forms a major part of my portfolio and I bought it very low, a year or so before the split (it was around $250 a share). 

I seem to be the only one (like, shareholder-wise) that doesn't buy into the Elon Musk cult of personality. I think he's a capable engineer and, in all likelihood, a skilled high-level manager. But just because TSLA has performed well for me doesn't mean I think he's this benevolent mega-genius. Honestly, outside of the two things I listed, I think he honestly kind of sucks. 

I also do not buy into the charade of his free speech polemics. I notice few people do. And despite his claims he's a free speech absolutist, I think his record in the past shows otherwise, unless it is to his material self-interest. 

The right-wing faith that Elon is the master safeguard of freedom is, in my opinion, entirely misplaced.",positive

[These are very illiquid, low-priced stocks.  Their price quantization (tick size) is large compared to their value, which produces fractionally larger discrete steps on the chart than higher priced stocks.  This looks more erratic and not smooth.  Because they are not traded as regularly as large cap stocks, they are more prone to large discrete price and volume jumps and returns, again, looking erratic.  Contrast this on your trading platform with AAPL, AMZN, TSLA, or SPY, where price per share and volume traded per unit time are much higher.

[He disclosed his 8000 puts position first time in Q1 this year ~~, not Q4 2020~~. Tesla peaked at 900 in Q1, so there's a chance that his average is pretty good. Just to show off, he rounded up to ~10000 puts in Q2.   We'll find out next month if he got out or nah.  EDIT: I forgot about him mentioning he is short TSLA back in December 2020.

[Of course you've been down voted, not only are you accurate, but most of the hate here is because they don't understand that TSLA is an energy company vs. a car manufacturer. They have created both the car and the oil company. There tech is about 5 years ahead of the industry, and there economy of scale will ensure that market share will be maintained.   But yeah, go ahead and down vote because you don't understand their business model and literally think it's about just selling cars.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q5eq7x/burry_is_a_tough_guy/hg6cixf/)

I do know a lot of people willing to spend 20k on a Ford Maverick though, so I think Ford is undervalued dramatically.  That being said though, I think the whole market is in a very real bubble (except GME of course). Stocks are being prices WAY over what their earnings are and the market has been on a nearly nonstop bull run for the past 13 years, which is unheard of.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q5eq7x/burry_is_a_tough_guy/hg5o39d/)

[Haha, did you even read your own post? You're shilling for a company at the detriment of its shareholders. What is the point of owning a stock when it doesn't give you a part of the profits the company makes? There is no true ""ownership"" for stockholders in companies that pay no dividends. You're essentially gambling on capital appreciation, but that's it. That's not responsible investment, and it's a sign of the clown market we're in today. When this ridiculous bubble bursts there will be a lot of people scrambling for that exit to preserve those capital gains, lest they be left with the weight of bags as heavy as the moon itself. Buy AMZN or TSLA now at your own peril. But be prepared for a landslide when these stocks start falling 10+ percent, as it will leave all those people who bought at the top trapped. And certainly don't come crying when the losses will amount to 30+ percent when it comes tumbling down.   But I'm sure all that is going to be dismissed again, as this ruins the perma-bull party. Every generation gets a major crash, and we're about due with this market.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q5eq7x/burry_is_a_tough_guy/hg60dzr/)

[Big difference between his  bet on housing and TSLA. On housing, he had the data on interest rate resets on defaults to identify a specific event (or series of events) that were happening at a certain time that would devalue the mortgages. The data was what it was. With TSLA, he is just assuming the valuation of the company is too high and driven by reckless speculative investing. There is no specific catalyst he can point to that will drive the price down. What he gets wrong is that just maybe the people saying TSLA should be worth thousands are correct about the growth TSLA will have and he is just wrong.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q5eq7x/burry_is_a_tough_guy/hg73oii/)

"You can't start comparing crypto to stocks.  Nothing is the same.  Also last night BTC got very close to a mid term collapse.  Another $1,000 down and no telling what would have happened. Could easily be headed back to $32k range.  BTC still has no way to value it other than what you will pay.  Maybe TSLA is like that.

BBIG has a few hedgies keeping the lid on while they load up.  Watch the action closely.  You will easily see what they are up to.  Hudson is $25 million under water.  They know more than all of us put together.  They aren't holding that position without talking to management.

I do believe this will go to the ""moon"" whatever that means to you with several stops along the way.  My hope is the management team has lots of help with the PR's and the timing. Those two things will be crucial for a moon shot.

&gt;Our price objective of $1,300 is based on 22.5x EV/Sales and 106x EV/EBITDA on our 2022 estimates, which implies roughly 4x EV/Sales and 25x EV/EBITDA on pro-forma capital-induced 2025 estimates.

&gt;  
&gt;Downside risks: 1) inability to continue raising low-cost capital to fund business ventures, 2) inability to generate positive earnings/FCF, 3) slower ramp in electric vehicle demand, 4) setbacks or lack of advancements in battery technology, 5) fierce competition from incumbent OEMs, 6) inability to execute efficiently with higher volume, 7) low gasoline prices, and 8) loss of management.

In that time I forgot about the wash sale, otherwise I would‚Äôve just held the share I bought since thats my plan once I buy TSLA again anyways. I recently had a good bit of money come in and decided to buy TSLA on the 8th even though the price I had shot up. Since I planned to hold for a while anyways I figured I‚Äôd just go ahead and get in. On Monday I sold @ $1145. I‚Äôm wondering If I need to wait 30 or 60 days to buy again. If I do buy again will my new buy in price be around $1200-$1100? If I buy more shares after the first, will the new shares count as buying around $1000? Hopefully I made that clear. Would it be worth it to go ahead and buy more if it drops to $800-$900, I planned on buying around 3 shares when the price is lower, but now I may have to wait a month or two",positive

Again, I‚Äôm not saying all or even most Musk/Tesla fans think this way.  But there is a large and growing minority that absolutely do.  

It‚Äôs dangerous and disturbing AF.  

Listen-

I was a HUGE Musk/Tesla fan pre Model 3.  Musk put his skin in the game and literally willed Tesla into a successful auto manufacturer.   He also put EVs on the radar screen. 

His SpaceX shit is cool AF.  

But I‚Äôm old enough, experienced enough and smart enough to see where he is today.  All my opinion of course but it‚Äôs a very educated one.  

It‚Äôs gotten to the point now where Tesla is never going to reach its potential with him at the helm.  He needs to step away and focus on what he truly loves..Just like Bezos &amp; Braniff.  

The problem with this is simple-

Even though I‚Äôm convinced that if Musk stepped away and was replaced with a competent CEO Tesla would flourish, I‚Äôm equally convinced that if Musk left TSLA would take a big hit.

KEYWORD : TSLA DATE : Sat Apr 23 04:11:28 2022 SUBREDDIT : stocks



[Here's the general idea behind the ""high P/E doesn't matter"" argument for so-called growth stocks. TSLA is the prime example but there are plenty of these in tech. The key behind the ""ignore P/E"" argument is the term ""growth"". For P/E to come down to non-insane sounding levels either the share price needs to go down (bad) or the earnings need to come up (good). So, the argument is, that companies with insanely high P/E -- *if they are expected to grow earnings fast enough* -- could be a great investment with a clear path to a reasonable P/E some months or years down the road.  For example, TSLA's P/E was over 1000 not too long ago, and it's now down to ~200. What happened? Did the price come down? Not really, quite the opposite. They simply started booking increasing earnings.  The reason Ford doesn't get the same hyper-bullish press and investor-base that Tesla gets, is because Tesla bulls are apparently very confident that *it will continue to grow earnings faster* than Ford will. So to a TSLA bull, the high P/E isn't a reason to favor Ford, it's largely irrelevant if you're confident in expected growth.  There are plenty of counter-points you can make to this line of thinking, and there are obvious risks such as ""what if they don't hit expectations"" -- but this is the argument. In TSLA's case, yes it has a cult-like following with Elon, but they've also been smashing earnings growth *beyond* expectations, so the ""ignore P/E"" rationale on TSLA in particular has been (so far) a damn good investing thesis to act upon.](/r/stocks/comments/u9y5xj/can_someone_explain_the_overvaluation_of_tesla/i5ulbqn/)

Another year, another bubble bites the dust.

We‚Äôre talking, of course, about the bubble in hypergrowth stocks like those owned by the ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund (ticker: ARKK). In this space one year ago, I highlighted the fund and the stocks in it as a potential bubble, and it looks like it has popped. Big holdings like Roku (ROKU), Teladoc Health (TDOC), and Zoom Video Communications (ZM) have tumbled more than 30% over the past year, and ARK Innovation looks set to finish the year down more than 20%, despite a banner year from Tesla (TSLA), its largest holding.


Worse still, despite the fund‚Äôs fantastic gains since it was launched in 2014‚Äîit‚Äôs returned more than 340%‚Äîits investors have been terrible market timers. They poured billions into the fund during 2020 and the beginning of 2021, driving its flow-weighted price to about $109, according to StoneX strategist Vincent Deluard, or 16% above Wednesday‚Äôs close of $93.83.

Big drops often look like big opportunities, but there‚Äôs likely more downside ahead for ARK Innovation. 22V Research‚Äôs John Roque notes that the ETF‚Äôs big drop has left it looking oversold, but it still hasn‚Äôt been able to meaningfully rally. It continues to trade below its 40-week moving average, while its chart relative to the S&amp;P 500 also looks uninspiring. Roque expects the ETF to continue on a downward slide toward $60, or 36% below Wednesday‚Äôs close. ‚Äú[The] inability to bounce after recording an oversold reading suggests firmly that the item in question is not finished going down,‚Äù he writes.

The bubble in fast-growing disrupters wasn‚Äôt the only one that seemed to pop in 2021. Solar and clean-energy stocks, which soared in 2020, slumped this year, with both the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) and the Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) off nearly 40% from their 52-week highs. Special purpose acquisition companies, so hot during the last few months of 2020 and into ‚Äô21, ultimately fizzled out, with the Defiance Next Gen SPAC Derived ETF (SPAK) also falling about 40% from its February high.

As with previous years, the overall market weathered the storm. The bubble stocks either weren‚Äôt big enough to make a dent in the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs returns or weren‚Äôt in the index. With two days left to go in 2021, the S&amp;P 500 was up 28%, on pace for its best year since 2019. But with the index trading at 21.9 times forward earnings, questions remain about whether the entire market itself is a bubble.


The fact that the index‚Äôs gains roughly equaled its rate of earnings growth suggests that it‚Äôs not. The high valuations combined with speculative behavior from retail investors and the massive concentration in a small number of stocks suggests it is‚Äîand the bubble spotters sound quite sure of themselves. ‚ÄúYes, we are in a huge‚Äîperhaps unprecedented‚Äîequity market bubble and it keeps getting bigger and bigger,‚Äù writes Rosenberg Research founder David Rosenberg.

The Stock Market Had a Wonderful Year. It Might Have Been the Only One.
No matter what you want to call the current run-up, large-cap valuations are high enough that investors shouldn‚Äôt expect much over the next decade, according to BofA Securities strategist Jill Carey Hall. At just under 21 times earnings, the large-cap Russell 1000 appears set to return just 1.7% over the next 10 years, based on the historical correlation between valuations and earnings. Small-caps, though, look set to do far better. The small-stock Russell 2000, at 15.5 times forward earnings, would imply an 8.8% annualized return.

Trying to convince people of the merits of small-caps might not be easy. The Russell 2000, though up 14% in 2021, still lags the Russell 1000 by about 12 percentage points and looks set to underperform for a fifth consecutive year. Still, it‚Äôs only a certain kind of low-quality small-cap that‚Äôs had a tough time in 2021, and those companies make up about a quarter of the index. That helps explain why the S&amp;P Small Cap 600, which has just a tenth of its portfolio in non-earners, has gained 26% this year, only a touch behind S&amp;P 500.


The 11 percentage-point gap between the Russell 2000 and the S&amp;P Small Cap 600 is the largest since 2000. That, of course, was the peak of the dot-com bubble, which marked the beginning of a period of strength for small-cap stocks. And while the S&amp;P 600 continued to outpace the Russell 2000 over the next two years, both outperformed the S&amp;P 500. Hall expects something similar in the years ahead.

‚ÄúAnd if today‚Äôs market environment shares some similarities with ‚Äò99/‚Äô00‚Ä¶this could prove to be a strong decade for small caps,‚Äù Hall writes.

"That's half the point. It's absurd that the health of your retirement fund hinges on Jeff Bezos's decision on whether or not to buy a yacht. Forcing people to sell off stock via the tax code helps head off *arbitrary* overvaluation. 

Could you earn more if buy and hold forever is normalized? Sure‚Äîthat's how TSLA and GME got so high‚Äîbut ""I can earn more"" is not ""we are economically better off as a whole."" It's like your grandparents who bought a house for $30,000 and now sit on it valued at $3,000,000. Yes, they earned a lot of money, but that wealth is evidence of a *broken* system, not a well-functioning one. The valuation locks out *new* buyers, because current owners have an incentive to hold forever.",positive
"Fed is right and their statements make sense. I love the ease of cashapp and robinhoods trading - it is super simple for people to use; however, it also allows people to quickly act on these impulsive trends in echo chambers pushing companies, which unlike TSLA (most likely inflated and the article notes similar inflation asserts), have no future market potential. It‚Äôs not really the fault of those apps though that encourage retail investors, it‚Äôs the meme push as the article says in communities for people to continue pumping that creates unique and dangerous volatility.

"pretty much, but better focus on the actual luxury of high end rather than just proving the tech (which TSLA had to do). Some tech improvements in it that are very nice (higher voltage, can can be power pack for home, better efficiency, higher rpm motor, etc) and they don't seem to be pouring _tons_ of money on the still-5-years-away self-driving tech. 

Production problems will always happen, esp with supply chains as fucked as they are now, but they have a solid 80k orders already placed plus options for 50k more (saudi 100k deal total), delivery of which will be the real kickoff I think. So 2023 ish liftoff",positive
"Yeah, I also overextended a bit. I‚Äôve more than 15x on Tesla over the last 5 years and have far beyond taken out my original cost basis + a lot more for house/car/solar etc. It has definitely made me riskier with my view on Tesla.

They just execute well in spaces that are considered competitive.  Needs to be replaced include the current CEOs of SKLZ, MILE, ADT and most of the marijuana companies. I'm on the fence about TDOC after that overpriced Livongo acquisition (their ROIC is going to be terrible for years to come, but could be worth it eventually... maybe). The EV and traditional automakers' CEOs may end up on this list in a few years as they continue to fall into cyclical traps.  I disagree with some of the replacement picks. The current CEO of T is actually executing well on a great plan to turn T around, but sentiment remains skeptical.

A lot of jobs use algos now and if it doesn't hit key words even if you ARE a good fit the algo might say you only match the job ""20%, etc""  &amp;#x200B;  3) Do the quick apply option on the 3 sites above and it will save a lot of time  4) Don't have a list of skills saying simply things like ""Team Work, Accountability, Good Time Management, etc"" under a header.

NYSE:WMT / 10

[So, I know this is, like, a confusing/worrying number of stocks maybe, but think of it from this context. I had a problem for months and months with pay to win games on my phone. I pissed away hundreds on bullshit, and I still have spending problems. And I know that robinhood was in trouble specifically for making stocks seem like a game, and that's the app where I've bought most of these. But...  1) Even at a loss, otherwise I was going to compulsively spend the money anyway. At least this way some is recoverable.  2) This is for practice and it's for long term.

Herbert Diess, CEO of VW, called in his company's archrival, Elon Musk, to explain how they're manufacturing better and faster.

And autonomous vehicles are coming. And Dojo as a Neural Network As A Service is coming. And solar roofs and home battery storage are coming. And industry and grid scale storage is coming. And Tesla as a utility scale electricity provider is coming. None of these are included in the valuation, mainly because they are not yet deployed on the scale that can be valued.

However, the S&amp;P 500's over-valuation shouldn't be ignored, as such I'd suggest reading ""One Up On Wall Street"" a few times and then executing it. It is scary that some of the stocks you pick are going to do poorly, and if you aren't mentally prepared for that, then just buy the S&amp;P 500. But if you can find a few great companies at fair prices, then you should outperform the S&amp;P 500 even if you pick some duds.

[I'm trying, but obviously an ape.  Also apologize about responding to incorrect comments, I can't get to our full Convo.  Short hedge funds don't want to buy shares to close shorts way above where they originally shorted.  Instead, they open a buy-write with a market maker, for deep otm options, the only cost to them is premium, much cheaper than covering shorts directly.    The first transactions allow short hedge fund to cover their shorts, but creates the synthetic short that will now need to be covered (eventually closed).  The system now has synthetic shares in it, until the synthetic shorts are completely closed.  After the first transaction, the buy-write resets the synthetic short positions to the next expiration chosen and so on.  They short, use swaps, buy long, etc to make money on the moves, but I believe the shorts are stuck in this cycle of paying premiums.  They also need to try letting air out of the balloon, before it pops, so each cycle some synthetic short positions must be closed.    I think DFV and RC know.  By tracking large otm option expirations, to determine which time period the price will rise/fall, roughly.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sl1iip/no_fun_2022/hvsb3ny/)

Gme board silence is good considering the crooks at the street will use anything against them or front run their ideas, if you had any clue what your talking about or what has been going on this whole time you would know media hates this situation, they post 8-12 negative bs articles everyday regurgitating the same crap yet nobody sells.

NYSE:MA / 6

[Others have responded to your core question, but here's my two pence on MAs in general.   You can use moving averages in different ways. Some things to think about (this works for me trading futures FYI):  1. Certain MA/EMAs often see a price response, these are tradable events. 21 and 200 work well for me, but you should backtest these on the timeframes and charts you're trading (this is pretty consistent across timeframes so you need to decide which you are comfortable trading). I wouldnt blindly trade these events though, ideally look for a price action response (maybe a wedge, or double top, or hammer on a lower timeframe when looking at the hourly 21 for example) and only use this when price is trending.   2. EMAs can give you a better sense of the trend. How steep is the slope? How far apart are they fanning out from each other? Obviously you can eye ball this though from price action too.  3. The zone between the 21 and 55 is usually a good area to keep an eye on for a pullback trade in a trend. A wedge or div on an oscillator into this area during in a trend are my bread and butter trades.  4. Don't put much weight on moving averages in ranges, focus more on finding your edge at the extremes of the ranges, either with a mean reversion play or a breakout play.](/r/Daytrading/comments/skq4nn/whats_the_effect_of_using_the_same_moving_average/hvnq6ra/)

"At 16 I think you should learn financial planning, budgeting, compound interest, personal finance, etc. first. I think too many people dive head into crypto here with just a goal of getting rich quick. That's unhealthy.

For everyone who tells you how much they made from when they bought, sure that's great. There are just as many people who made big bucks from TSLA, AMZN, AAPL, GME, AMC, etc. If we all had crystal balls, no one would be talking here about trying to get rich.

Look, I think it's really important to figure out finances first. Figure out how much you can budget into savings, and then determine what % of savings goes into crypto. Going 100% might be fine at your age, but I recommend not to think of it like that. Starting a Roth IRA at a young age is also a good idea that I think everyone should think of. The tax free growth is unbeatable.

But seriously, don't just think about how every dollar can to go crypto. Budget for savings, and budget for crypto, and it'll all come naturally.

[NVDA can grow by capturing more of the sales price of the GPU.  Which they are kind of doing now by (finally) pricing the high end GPUs in the thousands.  I'm not sure if it's bullish.  It kind of makes me think NVDA is dumb?  They have left literally billions of dollars on the table for years by selling their cards to resellers for $400, who sell them for $450 to scalpers, who sell them on ebay for $1200.    NVDA should have just upped the wholesale price to $1150 and 8xed their profit.  **Now the real caution to options players: NVDA can beat and the SP can still drop, seen it many many times.  Or the SP can even go up, and you still lose money on IV crush.**  To make money on earnings you need to have bought the calls at a low IV, and the beat needs to actually surprise wall street enough that it makes sellers turn into buyers.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/su2xb3/caution_to_people_playing_nvda_today/hx7f0ri/)

"[A doji basically means it opened and closed at the same spot. This is in decision between bulls and bears.   A hammer means either bulls or bears took control of that candle. If a big wick is at top, then bears took control, if a long wick at bottom, then bulls take control.   The best way to learn if the look for them on a chart. Use the 1 minute on a big stock like AAPL, SPY, QQQ, or AMD.   Also important to note that the way they're used could be slightly different between stocks. It's important to see how they're played on a specific stock vs using a blind rule for all stocks.   Essentially, you can use any doji or hammer the same way. Dont get caught in all the fancy names, and think of them as being somewhat universal.   Dojis and Hammers are best combined with the time or prior movement.   So look at a 1 minute chart of AAPL. When it falls hard, notice how often it reverses with a bullish hammer?   Also, notice when you look at the 1 minute chart with AAPL, and when the RSI goes oversold, and you have a big Green bullish bar, then a doji... It likely pulls back. Not always, but alot.   I only trade 5 stocks, and over time you can get to recognize little things like this.](/r/Daytrading/comments/trw9b3/candlestick_patterns/i2ocuzi/)

[Mostly in the Megacaps (MSFT, GOOG, AAPL, AMZN) because of their growth and moat.  Explosive growth is done but should have plenty of 20%+ CAGR left in them.  Also got some large Canadian companies (TD, RY, ENB) because they are solid, steady, with lots of moat and still good overall returns.  Only got 1 flyer: DIS.  Went against my normal investing principles but I think it has a shot to leverage their IPs and unique brand positioning to become even more dominant in the entertainment world, even in the face of a changing entertainment landscape (i.e. streaming and metaverse).  Eventuially I think they will get the Star Wars movies/franchise right again and rake in billions and billions.  Those are each pretty small positions overall (largest is 2.5%).

[AMD, NVDA, MSFT, AAPL  The weighting changes as I may buy or sell more of each during extended up/down swings but these are my main 4.   AAPLs moat is undeniably the best imo. More and more people will continue to switch to Apple products as time progresses because it‚Äôs status. They just make so much damn money off their products it‚Äôs insane.   MSFT cloud business and ability to dominate government and private sector contracts. Only company along with AAPL I don‚Äôt believe I could live without (or it would at least be much harder to do so)  AMD Lisa Su is a great CEO. They continue to grow and improve their products exponentially. They realized the CPUs maximum capabilities were going to level out and introduced some amazing GPUs. Ability to pivot into other markets and innovate when required is promising. I think AMD will continue to eat into NVDAs GPU space in the PC gaming market.   NVDA no one will beat their AI in the next decade, this is their most. Their data center GPU market is exploding YoY and their vertically integrated design is outstanding. Along with NVDA name another product that tripled its selling price from its MSRP during the pandemic and stayed sold out. The amount of calculations required to sustain modern business/infrastructure is insane. The use of GPUs to conduct blockchain and AI interfaces will continue to grow. I view NVDA as the next trillion dollar company.](/r/stocks/comments/tse35a/what_are_your_long_term_holds_and_is_a_large/i2u5psf/)

"1 you don't need goog and googl. It's the same company just class A vs class C shares. If you really want the voting rights to Google just hold GOOGL and dump goog. 

2nd you are too diversified for your account balance. Not that you won't make a return but at this stage and with your holdings you might as well just buy the SP500 consistently. 

If you want to take on more risk to return ratio you might as well just through a grand in GOOGL or TSLA 

On the other hand if you are just starting and this is like your first $700 but you will be adding another $700 every 2 weeks or month or whatever the case. Then I mean. This isn't an aweful selection.  Not super risky,  good companies. But you are overlapping the SP500 quite a bit.

"My bear case is this:

- It's something that goes on in the background. Customers don't see it. We won't see ads for Origin on TV. So, absolutely zero name recognition. The big names like Pepsi will take all the credit. Therefore we'll never be spoken in the same sentence with stocks like TSLA and will not have a trajectory of shit like AMZN or TSLA. 

- To my point above, since the general public won't know about us - they won't invest in us. Chipotle burritos will continue to beat our share price because everyone knows Chipotle. People buy what they know. 

- Never bet against the fossil fuel industry. They will crush competition like it's nothing. 

- It's just not sexy. ""We turn wood into black stuff!""

- Huge companies like Dow have unlimited resources to develop their own processes.

- Having to get factories built, people trained and hired, just to make some more product so we can make more money. So, that makes it a long term and long time before we might see significant revenues. By that time you could have 2x-4x your money in another stock. People might bail once they realize how slow this boat is.

"The Mutual Fund That Ate Wall Street‚ÄîBased on an Index Few People Know About

Ôøº

Ôøº

Vanguard‚Äôs Total Stock Market Fund, at $1.3 trillion in assets, is a market unto itself‚Äîpowered by an unassuming index called CRSP

Everyone knows the New York Stock Exchange. And its rival, Nasdaq.

But there is a mutual fund that invests in stocks based on a relatively unknown market index that has grown so large it might be considered a third stock market unto itself.

That fund is the $1.3 trillion (yes,¬†trillion, including all share classes)¬†Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund¬†(VTSAX) and its exchange-traded-fund shares. The fund, from Vanguard Group, now accounts for 10% of all assets in U.S. stock mutual funds and ETFs in the market, according to Morningstar Inc. No other mutual fund or ETF comes close to it in asset size. The next largest is an $821 billion Vanguard S&amp;P 500 index fund.

The paradox is that this biggest beast among funds is tied to the most unassuming of stock indexes‚Äîthe CRSP U.S. Total Market Index, developed at the University of Chicago‚Äôs Booth School of Business.

Notes on the News

The news of the week in context, with Tyler Blint-Welsh.

Ôøº

While many investors may not be familiar with CRSP, the influence of the index and the Vanguard fund is felt minute to minute on Wall Street. Traders say they sometimes check the Vanguard fund‚Äôs ETF version, with the symbol¬†VTI, to get a better idea of what is happening in the market overall, since it effectively covers more stocks than any of the three major indexes‚Äîthe Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 index and Nasdaq Composite.

‚ÄúWhen the stock market is open, VTI gives you a better picture of what it‚Äôs doing than anything else,‚Äù says Rick Ferri, an investment adviser in Georgetown, Texas. The CRSP, he adds, ‚Äúdrives this gigantic mutual fund, and most of the general public doesn‚Äôt even know that CRSP exists.‚Äù

Just what is the CRSP index? It was designed by the Center for Research in Security Prices, or CRSP, a subsidiary of the University of Chicago‚Äôs business school until it became a university-owned limited liability company last year. One reason the CRSP index is relatively unknown among the general public is that it was built at Vanguard‚Äôs behest only a decade ago from a monthly research tool for academics into its current form as an investible index.

Because the CRSP index consists of more than 4,000 stocks‚Äîincluding everything from tiny (or microcap) stocks to blue-chip giants‚Äîit shows how the entire market is doing. By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tracks just 30 big-name stocks, the S&amp;P 500 follows the performance of 500 large companies and the Nasdaq consists of more than 3,500 stocks, many of them smaller.

Minimizing the impact

To be added to the CRSP index, a company must operate a for-profit U.S. business, have a stock-market value of at least $15 million, and at least 12.5% of its shares outstanding must trade publicly, among other criteria. CRSP adds and drops stocks every quarter, and reflects some big initial public offerings and secondary offerings in a matter of days.

Additions to the CRSP index‚Äîand thus, to the Vanguard fund‚Äîcan rock parts of the market. When 164 stocks were added to the index in mid-September, their combined trading volume that week doubled from the average of the prior four weeks, according to FactSet. And their prices jumped 3.6 percentage points more than comparable microcap stocks in the same five-week period.

Elisabeth Kashner, director of global fund analytics at FactSet, says some ‚Äúmarket impact and front running‚Äù are inevitable when there is such a sizable buyer.

CRSP Chief Executive David Barclay acknowledges that some market participants may seek ‚Äúa way to get in front of‚Äù trading related to index changes. The 100-plus subscribers to CRSP‚Äôs index include big Wall Street dealers, hedge funds and market makers.

He says CRSP has taken steps to reduce the market impact of trading by funds like Vanguard. When it adds new stocks in the quarterly rebalancing, for example, it adds them over a five-day period rather than all at once.

CRSP tracks dozens of corporate actions daily, from dividends and stock sales to acquisitions or IPOs, to ensure the index weights companies in proportion to their shares outstanding and its database reflects their dividend rates. On Nov. 11, the index weights for¬†Avenue Therapeutics¬†Inc.,¬†ATXI¬†3.97%¬†Chinook Therapeutics¬†Inc.¬†KDNY¬†-3.68%¬†and¬†SiTime¬†Corp.¬†SITM¬†-4.34%¬†increased by a combined 0.00164% to reflect recent stock sales, and¬†Arhaus¬†Inc.¬†ARHS¬†-5.07%¬†and¬†NerdWallet¬†Inc.¬†NRDS¬†-10.14%¬†were added at 0.00067% of the index to reflect their IPOs a week earlier. (By comparison,¬†Apple¬†Inc.¬†AAPL¬†-1.17%¬†was 4.87% of the index.)

Sauter‚Äôs brainchild

CRSP began life in 1960 as a $300,000 research project backed by Wall Street‚Äôs then-largest brokerage firm, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc., which wanted evidence that stocks were a good investment.

The index‚Äôs development with Vanguard‚Äôs backing was the brainchild of a University of Chicago business graduate, Gus Sauter, who became Vanguard‚Äôs head of stock index funds in 1987.

Vanguard‚Äôs original index fund, launched in 1976, had used the S&amp;P 500, which then included only about 75% of the market. In 1992, Vanguard launched a total U.S. market fund to give investors the opportunity to invest in the entire market. The fund originally followed the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index. Vanguard in 2005 moved it to Morgan Stanley Capital International, now known as¬†MSCI¬†Inc.,¬†MSCI¬†-4.15%¬†partly because Wilshire didn‚Äôt adjust stock-index weightings based on shares publicly traded, known as a stock‚Äôs ‚Äúfloat.‚Äù That risked forcing the Vanguard fund to buy up too much of some companies‚Äô shares outstanding, distorting the price.

Not long after, Mr. Sauter asked Ted Snyder, then the dean of the University of Chicago business school, if CRSP could be cranked up from a research resource to a daily investible index, promising that Vanguard would advance the development expenses. Near the end of a five-year ramp-up, Vanguard announced the fund‚Äôs index would shift to CRSP in 2013.

Mr. Sauter says cost-cutting was a ‚Äúvery significant‚Äù reason Vanguard shifted to CRSP. Vanguard currently pays CRSP about $20 million annually to license its indexes. But he adds that CRSP‚Äôs long experience in stock-market research and its database made Vanguard confident that CRSP could provide a quality index.

Vanguard‚Äôs current equity index chief, Rodney Comegys, said Mr. Sauter‚Äôs approach with CRSP gave the Vanguard fund a long-term low-cost structure.

Tesla boost

Last year, CRSP and the Vanguard fund scored a win over its biggest U.S.-fund rival, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, when¬†Tesla¬†Inc.¬†TSLA¬†-6.42%¬†stock rocketed up more than 700%. Tesla wasn‚Äôt part of the S&amp;P 500 for most of the year because S&amp;P requires new additions to be profitable, while CRSP doesn‚Äôt.

Partly because Tesla was in the CRSP index, the index‚Äôs 2020 return of 20.99% (and that of the Vanguard fund) beat the S&amp;P 500 by 2.59 percentage points, the widest margin of outperformance by either index since 2013, according to Bull and Bear Profits, an investment newsletter. (Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, no longer has an ownership stake in S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, though Journal editors are on the committee that picks the stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.)

The Vanguard fund‚Äôs assets have mushroomed by 10 times since 2009, according to Morningstar. Its current size equals roughly 2.8% of the entire U.S. stock market.

A future in futures?

CRSP aims to expand its business by creating new indexes from its database of 11,300 securities and attracting new users in both investment management and academia. In September it launched six ESG indexes based on environmental, social and governance factors with proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services.

‚ÄúWe want to increase the ability for our research database to be used more broadly,‚Äù said Mr. Barclay.

On a Wednesday in mid-November at CRSP‚Äôs offices in a nondescript office building in downtown Chicago, CRSP managing director Eric Frait ‚Äîa veteran Chicago options executive‚Äîwatched as Bloomberg Television displayed a series of six boxes with pre-opening futures data based on the Dow, S&amp;P, Nasdaq and even the Toronto Stock Exchange. CRSP, he says, might rate a TV data box, too, if it had futures.

CRSP does, in fact, hope to develop a market for futures‚Äîtied to the total market index, Mr. Frait says.

[TDOC. Holding 490 stocks at 145 (-29% after today's 12% run up). TDOC acquired LVGO at 18B last year, and now TDOC is worth just 15B. The earnings reports have been great, so are the projections. Just because covid will be over at some point doesn't mean tele medicine will be done as well. Also, TDOC is now below the pre-covid price level, not like the other pandemic stocks, which despite the bloodbath they faced lately, are still considerably up from pre-pandemic values (E.g. zoom, though -56% compared to the ATH in Jan/Feb this year, is more than 100% up since Jan 2020).  That being said, I must admit that if I break even at some point (fingers crossed), I am gonna reduce my holdings by 50% or so. Almost 50k in a risky asset is a bit too much.  Other two that I am highly invested as well are BABA and BIDU. However, these ones, though I am pretty confident about the companies moat, I have no idea how the US/China politics will play out. So these ones, I am really gambling. A very high risk, high reward gamble. Together in these two, I have around 123K invested ( but worth now around 100k at the moment, around -19% down). These two also, if I get closer to -10%, I will reduce my holdings by 30-50% and sleep a little bit better.](/r/stocks/comments/rincr4/whats_your_worst_performing_stock_that_you_still/hoyolnk/)

[BABA, DIS, ADBE and LUV   Alibaba, I'm banking on the CCPs sensibilities, they've always been pro business just need Ma to tow the line, he will.   Disney, great opening theme post covid. Significant revenue from theme parks which was probably priced in at 205 but isn't now. Great price to accumulate.  Adobe, load of nonsense causing the stock to fall, now twice ~ 15% even after bouncing back in space of 2 months. 550s is great price. Definitely 700-750 mid next year.   LUV: yeah God know why it's falling amidst all the positive news (except for the one news 3 months back that they won't be making as much profit). People forget they've the largest cash balance and are yet taking help from govt to further expand their fleet.

[As a warning against this, you are still probably better off buying large popular names if you don't know what you're doing (GOOG, AAPL, MSFT, BRKB, etc). Looking for hidden gems with stock screeners when you don't know what you're doing is a very bad idea.  What I would agree with is that you shouldn't be investing in smaller speculative companies based solely on recommendations from Reddit and social media influencers.  In my experience it's very hard to find hidden gems though. It can be quite hard to really understand what the outlook is for a company that you're not that familiar with. I know what GOOG does, I know their track record, I know that they seem fairly valued so I have a confidence making an investment. When I find a cheap stock on a screener I often think they great after doing a bit of research, but then after consistently losing money on the stock I'll find out there was some risk I was unaware of. Imagine if a FB or INTC showed up on a screener for example, you might think these are great buys based on fundamentals and some limited research into what they do. But thankfully FB and INTC are large enough and discussed regularly enough that most of us are aware that that there are several risks with these companies which is why they're so cheap.  These days when I look for smaller unknown stocks to invest in I have to obsessively research and follow them for at least a month. I'll follow the company and leadership on Twitter. Listen to their last year of earnings calls. Read all the analyst research. See what people are saying about the company on platforms like Stocktwits, Twitter, etc. Read reviews on Trustpilot and Glassdoor. After a while you start to get a feel for where the company is heading beyond the story painted by its fundamentals.](/r/stocks/comments/tdhrx2/a_friendly_reminder_that_there_are_almost_10000/i0m1z8d/)

"There are some serious holes in this logic, though, given Toyota produces 10x Tesla's annual production. As I said in another thread, if Tesla wants to grow from 1M output this year to 2M next year, that's a 100% growth which by your math should double the share price. But for Toyota that's a 10% increase in output so therefore a 10% increase of share price?

And again, all while they're already producing 10x the vehicles. Let's compare some data?

Toyota (TM):

* Shares Outstanding: 1.39B
* 50-Day Moving Average: 178.02
* Profit Margin: 9.77%
* Operating Margin: 10.41%
* Revenue (ttm): 30.55T
* Revenue Per Share (ttm): 21,852.79
* Quarterly Revenue Growth (yoy): 72.50%
* Gross Profit (ttm): 4.83T
* EBITDA: 4.56T
* Net Income Avi to Common (ttm): 2.98T
* Diluted EPS (ttm): 18.58
* Quarterly Earnings Growth (yoy): 465.20%

Pretty excellent growth figures, solid revenue numbers, stable 50 day average price.

Tesla (TSLA):

* Shares Outstanding: 1B
* 50-Day Moving Average: 788.41
* Profit Margin: 7.40%
* Operating Margin (ttm): 9.57%
* Revenue (ttm): 46.85B
* Revenue Per Share (ttm): 48.28
* Quarterly Revenue Growth (yoy): 56.80%
* Gross Profit (ttm): 6.63B
* EBITDA: 7.17B
* Net Income Avi to Common (ttm): 3.47B
* Diluted EPS (ttm): 3.07
* Quarterly Earnings Growth (yoy): 388.80%

So we see Tesla has fewer outstanding shares at over 4x the average price, Tesla has a lower profit margin, a lower operating margin, revenue that is several orders of magnitude lower, revenue per share that is 452x lower, the quarterly YoY growth is lower, the net income is lower, and the quarterly earnings growth between this year and last is lower.

But somehow Tesla is priced higher than Toyota? Just looking at the numbers, and knowing the fact that Tesla will have to 10x its current peak annual output to match Toyota, you have to realize that numbers are completely imaginary. It's based on hopes and dreams, and that's literally it.

We haven't even discussed the number of factories Toyota has, nor their own vertical integration (which is expansive to say the least), or the amount of investment Tesla would need to make to match either of those.",positive

in 2013, TSLA market cap was 3b, LCID has a valuation of 72b now

TSLA is still overvalued, but i'm slowly accepting their valuation as they are primed to take over the total sales of ford/gm/bmw by 2025 and become the apple of EVs. 

companies like LCID and RIVN is so far away from that it makes no sense to compare it with TSLA other than the fact that they are EV companies which there are dozens out there",positive

"Pierre Ferragu (notre gars s√ªr) is back with a $1580 PT

&gt;Tesla is poised for 50% breakout higher off strong 2022 catalysts - New Street Research

&gt;New Street Research boosts its price target on Tesla¬†(NASDAQ:TSLA)¬†to $1,580 to mark a new Street high.

&gt;Analyst Pierre Ferragu and team point to multiple strong catalysts for Tesla (TSLA) in looking ahead to 2022. Tesla (TSLA) is seen ending this year with an annualized production run-rate of well above 1M units and being likely to deliver a strong Q4 earnings beat. Production out of Berlin and Texas is anticipated to ramp during the year to help the automaker hit 1.5M total deliveries vs. 1.4M consensus and margins are seen cracking the 30% level by the end of the year, despite the ramp of the two factories. Further manufacturing efficiency improvements could help in that regard.

&gt;Expect to hear more 4680 talk with Tesla in the year ahead. ""We expect 4680 production to be in full swing by year end and grow rapidly from there, and new sites to break ground in order to maintain ~50% annual growth,"" previews Ferragu.

&gt;New Street Research's price target of $1,580 is based on TSLA trading comfortably at the higher end of the 50X to 100X P/E range. The PT reps right at 50% upside for Tesla (TSLA) from yesterday's closing price and is well in front of the all-time high of $1,243.49.

"People here need to realize why solar city looks like a bailout.  In retrospect, tesla bought the company and drove its market share down from 30% to less than 10% over a 5 year period.  

4Q16 solar deployments were at 200MW.  4Q20 solar deployments were at 86MW. 

As of 2019, SunRun was the market leader with over 10% US market share.  SunRun is currently valued at $9B - $10B. 

‚ÄúSunrun had previously reported third quarter 2020 deployments of 109MW, a 40% sequential increase.‚Äù

‚ÄúSunrun‚Äôs solar deployments are more than double those deployments of Tesla in 2020.‚Äù

Tesla bought solar city for $5B including its debt.  However, tesla sold stocks to cover then acquisition and later its debts.  This presents a past value opportunity cost of $5B of tsla at a stock price of $40 (2016).  Present value cost of this acquisition was about $80B ($653/$40 * $5B), excluding any operating gains of loses since the acquisition.

So in summary, tsla bought a distressed company, then cut its production massively for the next 5 years, gave up 2/3rd of its market share, at a present day value of $80B. 

Would we have been better letting solar city go bankrupt, then buying it for $1B?  I think so.  And the present day numbers and market share support that valuation.  

How this would have affected Elons ability to run tesla is another story, which in an ideal world would have a quantitative value that could be weighed against the seemingly bailout cost. Maybe it was worth it because tesla preformed better without Elon distracted by his personal situation.  But also maybe the company did worse by being distracted by its failing solar business and legal issues with the Buffalo factory agreement.

This is why we allow bankruptcy laws.  Seeing bankruptcy as enviable, but then buying the company at more than full value instead of taking a capitalist approach is why Elon is in the hot seat.  Right or wrong.

Was it a bailout?  Probably not exactly.  But the appearances over time are working against Elon.  Even though they make sense considering the need to prioritize focus on model 3 ramp up.  But again, that was a projected difficulty and tesla still chose to purchase solar city when it was already going to be bogged down with ramping the first mass production EV.  Again a questionable choice when in the rear view mirror.

"Would be interesting to find out how much of his net worth is invested in TSLA.  Considering he's raising money to buy more shares, I would think it's a majority holding of his net worth, but it could also be that he has lots more money but in non-liquid assets (like real estate) and raising money is just using his property as collateral.  Big risk, but big reward, too.",positive
"Exactly. I grew up with crypto all the way since Bitcoin launched in 2009. You couldn't really purchase vast amounts until a failed magic the gathering store (MTGOX) decided to rebrand as a trading platform for BTC.

Bam, overnight Bitcoin jumped to $100 a coin. Then go figure, tons of hackers repeatedly hacked the platform to transfer off Bitcoin you didn't immediately store in a wallet you secured.  Back then no hardware wallets either. Tons of malware around waiting for you to unlock your wallet. Only way you could do Bitcoin securely at the time was a laptop you never connected to the internet. There was even a worm that transferred by sound waves taking advantage of buggy sound drivers back then just to grab bitcoins so that laptop had to be incredibly locked down.

Then MTGOX decided to scam a lot of people. People couldn't even trust their trading platform.

Not to add there was a lot of law enforcement concern back then. SEC investigations of MTGOX. FBI of silk road and all the other illegal usages Bitcoin made stuff easy.

Realistically you'd be a fool to have invested any significant net worth into Bitcoin back then before say under 1k-5k a coin.


Then today I view an investment in Bitcoin to be equal to single stock risk like TSLA, etc. You're betting that specific technology, community, etc will thrive, and survive.

The reality is Bitcoin sucks still. Transactions take forever to confirm still. It's still high fees at the time. Buying or selling any substantial amount of Bitcoin still affects the market. Liquidity dries up easily.

Less places take it these days. It's still not user friendly. People don't understand that it's equivalent to a wire transfer. There's no chargebacks or consumer protections if the seller doesn't deliver.

Finally it's still very ponzi like in that you need new investors to keep the price up and you'll need exponentially more new users to buy into the system to have it maintain the same historical growth rate. Unlike a company, Bitcoin isn't producing anything of value. You don't get any legal rights over the Blockchain software or patents. The community could decide to fork tomorrow and start over on a new Blockchain with new technology. Bitcoin 2.0.

Ultimately it's a lot like gold. I remember Warren Buffett would rather own all the farmland in the United States than own all the gold in the world. Farmland produces more GDP, more growth, and more returns on investment. If the USA fails then farmed goods still can be bartered with. If bartering fails, then you still can consume and survive. 

Gold on the other hand is only worth what others want to pay for it at the time.",positive
"The IRS also doesn't charge people taxes on unrealized gains, so what makes you think they wouldn't issue refunds for unrealized losses on the back end?

Even if they don't issue refunds, imagine Musk's current situation. His company went from under $100 a share to over $1200 in the past 24 months. So what? He sells $30 billion of stock and gives it to the Treasury to pay his fair share?

So TSLA probably isn't actually worth $1 trillion+, that's more than all other automakers on earth combined. So say their stock goes back to some more reasonable valuation like a similar market cap to Toyota at $300 billion. Now what? Does the IRS just let him not pay taxes ever again? He would have a $100-150 billion loss to carry forward. Do they give him $20 billion back? 

It's such a stupid and asinine concept I can't even wrap my head around how they think this is going to work. I mean how is that even right from a moral perspective? If some company like GameStop is subject to a short squeeze that results in very temporary valuations that nevere were there and never will be sustained in the long run, we are going to just loot the founders stake in the company and give it to the government? Even though the squeeze happened through no choice of their own? And what about the perverse incentives this then creates? Now you have a conflict of interest where the founders of companies have a fiduciary duty to their shareholders to increase value while a very strong personal incentive to keep a lid on valuations. Is that how we want our economy to be functioning?",positive

"Gross margins will decrease most likely with the new factories. However I believe this is temporary. TSLA is driving towards more and more efficient manufacturing - that is their number one product. For instance, 4680 batteries, more and more gigacasting, and structural battery packs are new technologies which should drive gross margins up. 

Localizing production will also immediately offset the lower Berlin/Austin margins.

IMO Tesla's gross margins are one of their most important ""moats"". 

People think, oh Ford and GM and Toyota are production champions, they will catch Tesla quickly. Sure, they can probably spin production up fairly quickly (they are still way behind Tesla but we will set that aside), but how profitable is that production?",positive

Sure there‚Äôs FUD - but just a little digging would reveal how insanely challenging it is to build an efficient EV factory, make and source batteries, and actually turn a profit on the whole endeavor.

Also even colleagues of mine still believe that Rivian and Lucid are eventually going to crush TSLA.

[AMD is growing really fast in the data server processors (CPUs, DPUs). Their new acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando are going to help with this growth, which is a high margin business. And these companies add to free cash flow.  Now, I'm really bad with understanding hardware, but as I see it, they are taking market share, aggressively buying back shares, generating FCF, growing fast in a high margin business. Their slow down was more so in low-end PCs where INTC dominates.

You think TSLA is fairly valued at over $900 a share? You are a clown,positive
It's ~40T for SPY and TSLA is 1.2T so it's gotta be like 3% although there's some diluted vs. undiluted wrinkles,positive
"The situation is slightly more complex than that as she needs to rebalance her portfolio every time a name reaches 10% of the overall portfolio, hence a number of recent sales (i.e. She still owns 3 positions in TSLA with a cost average of $256.67 - $326.30, so clearly in the money). That being said, systematically doubling down on her losers (e.g. TDOC, DKNG) is surprising. 

There was an interview with Ross Gerber in which he stated that 1) the fund had only outperformed thanks to a couple of names such as TSLA over a fairly short period of time 2) her team is fairly inexperienced and is learning the hard way from their mistakes 3) that she does not question her thesis while the market is actually an ever changing beast and the macro environment has significantly changed. 

Absolutely no doubt in my mind that some of these names will be significantly larger over the next 5-10 years (e.g. SQ, SHOP, SE), but others are grossly overvalued (e.g. PLTR) or don't have a sustainable moat (e.g. ROKU) and the market is now paying more attention to fundamentals as it should!",positive

The question you need to ask yourself is, do you know of any investment that is better than Tesla? Anything that has an almost guaranteed growth over next 10 years?

[Naw, those are imaginary numbers.  Based on one time easy comps. The best Tesla can possibly doing going forward is decline during the supply chain China covid period, and then maybe if they perform well enough have a sustainable growth rate in the 30% range.  It is also important to see that the non-auto parts of the company are suffering and in decline, and that many top quality EV competitors are coming into the market rapidly.  In europe, all the big German luxury companies have great now models, in China there are many Chinese EV's now and in the US, where Tesla is strongest, there is also growing competition. Plus as we center a recessionary period and as car prices are high and may go higher, that is not a recipe for much growth.   Also, like AAPL or any other company ,manufacturing in China, this is going to be a lousy quarter.   some 30% of Chinese shipping and manufacturing is down now, and AAPL is managing it the best with their hermetically sealed covid-free manufacturing campuses where the workers are basically prisoners until the covid shutdowns are lifted.  Tim Cook is also the #1 master of supply chain issues and even he admits it is going to cost Apple around 10% this quarter, and ,maybe bleed into next quarter, depending on when china lifts its shutdowns.   Also, Tesla the company and the stock is very much associated with the cult-like faith in Musk himself.  His mov e on Twitter and blessing of Donald trump is a huge problem for him PR wise and may result in hundreds of thousands of well to do liberals taking their business elsewhere.

I've never really been an Apple fan as far as the company, but it's much like Nvidia and AMD. They all have a stranglehold on their respective markets.  Tesla and Amazon though? Tesla is an oddity. A luxury car brand with a fraction of market share and rapidly gaining competition brands with arguably more compelling products.  Amazon is Amazon. It's more than an online retailer, because of AWS but it's still fast overvalued because the pandemic boom in online ordering.

&gt; 3.	Retails faves. Crowded SaaS. Memes. Richly valued, limited liquidity. Is the second wave. Money moves to FANMG.
&gt; 4.	AMZN, NVDA, GOOG, FB. Flawed quality names, highly liquid. Third wave. Money moves to AAPL and MSFT.
&gt; 5.	AAPL, MSFT. Perfect quality names. Highly liquid. Final wave. TINA dead. Money moves out of equities.

and from u/wolverinex2

&gt; You actually could have added (after money moves out of equities) ""into Treasuries/MBS"" to replace the Fed buying. That's essentially what completes the cycle since the Fed is buying Treasuries/MBS partly to drive down rates and stabilize those markets, but also to free up private capital that can be invested elsewhere (often into stocks) and stimulate the economy

[I personally would sell today on the bump if I had shares.  The China sales numbers are going to be horrific.  It is estimated that 20-40% of Tesla's sales are in China.  How many cars do you think they're selling in Shanghai/Beijing (the two wealthiest Chinese cities) right now?  That's the short term thesis.  The long term thesis is that never in the history of the market has a company been able to hold on to this kind of market position for long.  Competition ALWAYS erodes.  Not even Microsoft (and Tesla is no Microsoft) could hold, back in the 1990's.  TSLA is not worth 12 times Ford.  They are running out of customers too.  Etc. Etc.  Edit:  Anecdotal, but everyone I know with a spare $100K is waiting on non-TSLA EV's to buy (BMW's, Porsche's, Ford F-150's, and the newer brand stuff).](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uxdeoo/if_you_would_have_invested_in_tesla_about_1_year/i9y0hkt/)

[Thanks for the input.   I agree that there's a chance that they will disappoint this qtr but I also think that after this qtr they are in a very strong position to perform at their high growth rate.   I think China lockdowns have a large impact on production, but less on deliveries, because they can export those vehicles to other countries.   Tesla's market share is guaranteed to erode from the competition but that doesn't necessarily equate to lower Tesla sales, the TAM is growing rapidly, and something like 80% of EV buyers are switching from ICE from one statistic I read, which shouldn't surprise anyone. There should be room for TSLA and the competition to rapidly grow, although of course at some point there will be demand constraints; I think it's clear that we will not be there in the near future, but of course I don't think anyone knows for sure.  Running out of customers... are they? What I've read from analysts is that TSLA has a cost advantage in manufacturing due to their vertical integration and innovative manufacturing techniques, while it is unknown whether the other major auto mfg's can turn a profit with EV's, and TSLA should be in a better position, compared to their competition, to lower their prices when competition requires it. I expect this will be a competitive advantage.  TSLA shouldn't be worth 12x Ford... I can tell you the the enterprise value of TSLA is &gt;4x that of Ford, and they have much higher profit margins, and they are growing much faster (much less growing at all), and TSLA has essentially no debt compared to a mountain of debt for Ford, and they don't have to cannibalize their core business to compete in the EV space... with all that considered, I think TSLA should be worth many multples of Ford, much more than 4x... does 12x seem unreasonable? I don't think so.  I am biased and I want them to succeed, but I think the argument that they are at least fairly valued is much stronger than the arguments I've see that they are undervalued.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uxdeoo/if_you_would_have_invested_in_tesla_about_1_year/i9zt05k/)

[Yes I'm green to all of this but have been putting in my time reading and watching vids on you tube. I know very little about this market game  To be honest I always thought only the rich played the stock market and its easy to lose your cash. I knew nothing about  etfs and mutual funds besides my pensions were handled by mass mutual and our money was in the stock market lol  Never had anyone in my family every invest so therefore I never paid attention to it until by brother in law was like hey why are you sitting on all of that cash. Umm idk. So he told me to look into mutual funds and etfs and stocks that are blue chip. Well mutual funds cost money I came up with more than etfs. I called around to Charles Schaub and Edward Jones and they were like sharks. They called 100x and the guy at Edward Jones was like look invest it all w me. Long story I felt turned off by them. I knew they wanted my money to make money. They also had all kinds of fees and charges. So I took the time and did my homework a bit and came up with what I thought was best. A broker account thru fidelity and add to it when I can afford too. Buy etfs and sit on them until I retire and hope it makes a few buck's. I took a piece of paper n pen and tallied up how many people on reddit liked vti vt. Vti had more tallies so I went with that as my core w vxus for int exposure. I'm at about 70/20 split w them. Reminder 10 % is stocks  So I opened up a robinhood account before all of the above   Backing up the story here... I found reddit and started looking around and I kept seeing game stop AMC and clov. Well GameSpot was too high per share for me.  AMC I think will be extinction soon. Left me with the stock called clov. Clover health. Try to make this short. Everyone kept raving about how it was at like 8 buxks and gonna shoot to the moon and everyone was gonna get rich lol. So gullible me I took 1200 and bought I think about 100ish shares of it and 1 share of chewy. My wife wanted it. Then I learned all of the rave was because it was a clov page lol  Long story short they stated then to transfer my account as robinhood sucks and the hf own it fo to fidelity or td America. Td America was a pain to setup so I opened up a fidelity account. I then took approx 10k and bought qqq vt and some vti. That week I was up like 400. I'm thinking woe this is easy and great. So I did more homework and asked qs. Guys said pick vt or vti. That's the above story on how I came about choosing them. So after 400 in one week I dumped about 23 24k more into vxus and vti then boom. Monday market tanked I was down like 600. That's when I was like ohh shit you can lose money lol.   So now that I have taken a step back I'm confident in my etf choices I just need tonrelax and let it ride. 16 yrs is a long term investment. It's gonna win and lose but should slowly over the yrs gain. I need to stop looking at the damn app 10x a day üôÑ   Reason I didn't do a Roth ira is I was told pay now or pay later. Biggest con to me was I can't touch the coin until in 59.5. As we talked earlier I may want that coin at 55](/r/stocks/comments/pyfu9h/remember_what_investing_is_all_about/hewefu9/)

I just want to point to the fact that it's still overvalued  rn. If a company which has a price tag of 700 billions and generates only FCF of 3 billions in 2026 it is simply overvalued. FCF therafter hasn't a high clip rate therafter. Given the current macroeconomics, uncertainty, and high commodity prices (lithium) I only see downside for the stock price.",positive

"&gt;Basically, how much runway does the company have to grow?

For growth stocks, that's my view, too!  What's the total addressable market that Tesla potentially has?  It seems to be growing every year in the EV space via high customer demand and govt incentives/subsidies.  Heck, some countries are banning ICE sales in a couple of years.  And utilities now want more batteries for their projects.  

I, too, don't weight my decision completely on price targets.  I'll calculate a price range via an Excel spreadsheet, but if the stock suddenly went higher than my guesstimated price range, does it make sense to sell, pay hefty taxes on profit, and get back into TSLA when it falls only to rinse and repeat?  For the seasoned and more savvy investor, that answer may be yes.  But I'm an idiot and suck at market timing, so as long as I'm not in the need for some cold-hard cash and Tesla hasn't changed anything that would change my investment confidence, I just hold.",positive

AMD, TSLA and Elon's other companies, Google back in the day, and Apple are all prime examples of this. I'm sure there are many countless others I'm not familiar with. When I start to see incompetence and more focus on short term profits rather than a more meristocratic structure, I see the opposite, MSFT through the early 2000's and Intel in the past 10 years being good examples although I think Intel might be turning things around now and MSFT obviously has its shit together now.",positive

"I guess in the end it depends on how the deal is structured.  At current share prices for TSLA, buying Twitter outright would be something like 50 million shares -- a pretty substantial shift in Musk's position.

If he's leveraging the buyout, that might be a bit different .. but what is he securing leverage with?  More TSLA shares probably ... so in the end that almost amounts to the same thing.

Either way, it doesn't seem like the question is, ""Does this deal involve Musk getting rid of a large Tesla holding?""  It seems like the answer to that is definitely, ""yes.""

The question is more, is that the central purpose for the deal?",positive

Who gives af about the textbook definition a bear market is one where stocks overall are declining. by the time it meets the textbook definition you read on investopedia you‚Äôll have lost all your money buying dips and will be telling yourself you‚Äôre an investor with a decades long time horizon while hoping for the bull market to resume. there isn‚Äôt a single major index that‚Äôs made a new high since the end of 2021 but people are still holding their breath waiting for tsla to get to $1500 lol. The tightening cycle has begun and given the slow pace at which the fed is moving its not going to end for a long time. Stocks are not going to perform well in this environment people keep making it more complicated than that but it‚Äôs not I do not understand how there are people who are extremely bullish I mean I do because they don‚Äôt know how to operate in a bear market so they hope but it‚Äôs still amazing to watch. The key to keeping what you made in a bull market is recognizing these things early and doing what you can to protect capital. If this market declines 50-60% over the course of a couple years while inflation is near double digits people will lose their savings and everything they made in the bull. This is what people who think the stock market just goes up over time don‚Äôt understand,positive

"Solar Batteries ai and robots are all within the tesla brand. Tesla does also own solar a solar installation company that it acquired, which is a different brand. Peloton, lol, is not a technology company. Tesla definitively is. Space X is not part of tesla, but I'm sure there's synergy. I think tesla and apple are basically perpetually undervalued. They are both driving innovation, disrupting sectors, and in some cases creating markets something 99.9% companies do not do. I think APPL and TSLA are stocks you can hold through death and pass on to your kids. Both APPL and tesla are minority shareholders in every market they compete in. Massive companies with room to grow who know how to innovate. Both have a people planet profit ethos. I'm pretty excited about rivian too, but to a lesser extent and in not such a grandiose way.",positive

And now that its passed Jan 1st, 2022, you want to sell because its been over a year since you first bought AAPL shares putting you over the ""Long term"" holdings.  Well in that case only the first 50 would count as ""Long term"" if you sold all right now. The other 50 would have to wait for June 2nd, 2022 to gain ""long term"" benefits.

[I don't understand your point.  If this is a true bear market, ppl will do well to continue to buy quality companies or ETFs while on sale.  By nature, the stock market gains more than it loses over time.  Buy the dip.  If you made the mistake to go into cash or precious metals during the great recession of 2008, you should know not to repeat the same behavior now.  Instead of hashtag GOLD, you would have been better off buying AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL and AMZN to name a few.

Especially after BJ's showed they were still making money (best comparison for COST imo).  AAPL prints money from their app store &amp; content sales: $35 billion in airpods alone so don't know why you'd bet that hard against them.  AMD is a chip business in a world where there is a chip shortage due to raw material acquisition issues... that's just a pure gamble on them being able to sell for a higher price on lower supply more than they lose on the reduced capacity costs.

I have an EV with FUSC for life and the gas cars just sit in the driveway. Its difficult to find a need to use them unless its for a road trip (which we are not doing with covid).  We saved a lot and dumped it all on AAPL while we eat better by ordering Harris Ranch steaks delivered to our doorstep next day frozen.

[SPX 0DTE only using credit spreads.  I don't use any indicators. I have a custom google spreadsheet that gives me percentile ranges for possible shifts in SPX over a 25 year timespan and I enter based on a mix of my percentile calculations and intuition. I also calculate max delta from high/low using percentiles and use that to make statistically sound strike placements.  I use near 100% of my capital per trade but strongly respect my 2x stop loss (which is generally less than 5% of my capital). I have a &gt; 92% win rate. My contract sizes are usually around 10-15.  Sometimes I leg into an iron condor, but that's fairly rare. I generally run to expiry. Sometimes I close early if I'm not confident.  In regards to entry timing, I basically watch for the volatility in the morning. I generally don't enter until mid day when the market has picked a solid direction. On the first turn I sell a spread in the direction of the original trend for max credit assuming it won't breach my percentile assumptions (usually around 3% max move per day).

IF(!) robotaxi happens that could very well be a good business model for them. There is always a middle man - whether you rent your robotaxi through Hertz or a private person. Only if Tesla does all the robotaxi stuff themselves with their own cars will Hertz have an issue. Tesla might (and musk has hinted as much) - but I don't think they will for the foreseeable future.

[They have had a three child policy since last year but it's already too late. Raising a child in China is more expensive than in the US or even Japan because of how competitive education is. When they released the three child policy, mother's were laughing. Most are still working just to afford one child, let alone three. It's the norm for grandma and grandpa to move in to take care of kids, take them to school, and such because both parents are working til 8pm. Unless the CCP directly addresses the cost of living to salary wage gap, the population has no where to go but down. It should be noted that the top rung of Chinese officials are all engineers. Everything to them is an engineering problem. They project power through engineering megaprojects but really don't have any clue about fixing social problems. Can't blame them, have they had to do that since the 70s? The middle class has exploded and everyone's wealth has been buoyed by international investment. People associate it with the CCP being cunning. But it won't be like that a decade from now. That's why they're making such a big push for AI, they won't have the numbers to sustain this level of production in our lifetimes. We just have to see how far they can take that. But I'm very bearish on the Chinese economy. I really wouldn't out any hope in it ending well.](/r/stocks/comments/toarrz/8_reasons_to_never_bet_against_the_us/i263t1i/)

[I stopped reading when I found Tesla at a rating of 1 with a nearly 5% weighting of QQQ.   I understand you're wanting to lump them into categories for the sake of your argument but the problem is they're far from just a car company.   I'm not going to get into an argument on Reddit about Tesla because it becomes political but I'll just say Tesla's mission has shifted from just car manufacturing to AI and obviously mass energy storage with the goal of replacing centralized utilities.   Ironically if Tesla was just a car company it wouldn't be valued at $1 trillion market cap and almost 5% QQQ. To drive my point home, why would ARK have Tesla as it's largest holding if it's just a car company?

[&gt;I personally am very bullish on TSLA and believe that it has a 90% chance of becoming the next biggest company in the world by 2030.  It is already valued higher than most of the other car companies combined.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;From what I see, no company can produce EVs as cheaply, as high quality and as many as Tesla (not even Chinese EVs).  Look at the recent reliability data. Tesla is dead last, even behind Dacia. Also other car manufacturers are slow to adapt but then fast. Tesla does not have the ability to produce 10m cars yearly. Toyota and VW do.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;They have the trifecta of manufacturing and EVs are still in the early adoption phase. Legacy auto makers have stagnant evaluations for the last decade.  Sure, but they pumped billions more into research than Tesla did, and current offerings from Hyundai, Kia and Porsche are considered excellent already. Adoption phase does not matter, as it is already valued as though it would surpass the others.  &gt;Tesla is also the current leader in FSD technology,  Where do you have the data? Musk promised since 2015 that it is basically solved and it will be here next year. Mercedes is the first Level 3 car with included liabilities and Venmo and Cruise are already driving in selected cities without a driver. How is FSD the leading technology?.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;although it has a long way to go, growth in AI is exponential and we will get there eventually within a reasonable time frame.  Yeah no. Even if everything goes smoothly, Level 5 autonomy everywhere will take at least a decade.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Tesla is going to be more of a robotaxi company than a car company. The economic gain of robotaxis is going to be insane, cars sit idle 95% of the time any decent economist will tell you that is money being lit on fire. If they can reduce that to just 70% idle, it will result in at least a trillion saved by not requiring a driver, increased speed of traffic, reduced accidents, and most importantly (in US and Canada) not being financially burdened by owning a car just to name a few.  I think you should do your calculation how much it actually saves (it is not a lot) - and how much it costs to maintain a vehicle that is driving most of the day. The driver of taxi companies gets around 30% of the fare. Include the R&amp;D costs of robotaxis and I can't see, how margins will be better than taxi companies (they have terrible margins).  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;It is more correct to say a Tesla revolution than an EV revolution.  How? It does not change how most people use their car. Au contraire, with increased competition, Tesla will either be forced to produce a cheap car -  so that they can really produce the amount of cars they are valued for - and thus decreasing margin, or they can have high margins with selling not a lot of cars. Either way, the multiple will suffer.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;I did my research on TSLA back in mid 2021 and I strongly believe that today, in terms of information available and TSLA financials, is the best time to invest because there is very little uncertainty. If your bearish on Tesla I want to know why and if I'm missing anything in my arguments.  If Tesla is your best idea, please search again. Also: Please look at the materials that go into a Tesla. Most of them more than doubled the last year -  decreasing margins further.](/r/stocks/comments/tny5je/those_who_are_bearish_on_tsla_what_are_your_main/i24551j/)

[Despite bull claims, Tesla is indeed an automotive manufacturer. It‚Äôs currently valued more than every other major automotive manufacturer combined, despite manufacturing a tiny fraction of the collective.  Like other manufacturers, it‚Äôs going to face cyclical demand cycles like any other automotive company. It enjoys wide profit margins now, where it has legitimate pricing power, that will likely get squeezed as other manufacturers release viable competition over the coming years, including their increased demand in the commodities constituting pays unique to EVs. Continued quality and service issues are more of an issue as more competitors that can offer traditional build quality and service networks come online.  Personally, I also despise Musk. He‚Äôs a pie in the sky dreamer who knows how to market, but the timeline claims, AI claims, Solar claims/lies, Solar self dealing, SpaceX reusability claims, mars missions claims, hyperloop claims, and the disaster that is the ‚Äúmass transit‚Äù solution for the Vegas convention center have lost all credibility for him as anything other than a good engineer willing and able to bankroll projects and say whatever he has to in order to stay in the news.  I also still remember the accounting mass exodus from a few years ago, where they seemed to have senior accounting out finance staff resigning every other week. While I trust PWC as an auditor, it‚Äôs a red flag still waving in the back of my mind.  TL;DR I don‚Äôt trust Elon and think Tesla is valued for practical perfection when perfection is unlikely.](/r/stocks/comments/tny5je/those_who_are_bearish_on_tsla_what_are_your_main/i242ygw/)

"&gt; I don't think it's fair to shit on him for that. Even Elon questioned the company's survival back then.

That's false. Elon was rallying employees via dramatic language, but Tesla's survival was never in doubt: in 2018 they were a couple of week away from ... doing another capital raise, like they did in early 2019 to the tune in $4b in much darker circumstances.

Tesla's ""survival"" was never truly in doubt once Elon took over as the CEO. The only open question was how much cash they needed to scale up. ü§∑

Elon acknowledged this last year, when he liked a tweet pointing out this history, and he stopped with the ""we were a few weeks away from running out of cash"" narrative then.

I do agree with not giving Adam Jonas crap for his $2 ''bearish TSLA price target' in 2019, as he clearly changed his mind - but I sure as hell will keep on with some lighthearted teasing for that ... unimaginative price target, and for his ""are Teslas going to turn into Terminators?"" trolling question on one of the 2019 ER calls.",positive
"Closed my puts from yesterday, but there is likely more meat on the bone with Tsla and PLTR looking pretty tired.",positive
"TSLA, based on their current product mix and production, is overvalued.  Thus they're relying heavily on huge future promises to keep the stock price pumped up.  The reason it's so hard to get this stock to drop in price is because some of the promises they're claiming are so huge and disruptive that they're hard to ignore.  Another problem is just how much funding is flowing into Tesla.  At this point, they have so many funds tied up in their stock, it's likely starving competitors of much needed capital, and almost guaranteeing that if any company succeeds, it'll be them.

[Investing is about as easy as tying shoelaces.  The MOST important aspect is understanding the difference between INVESTING and GAMBLING.  One should not stop ""investing"".   The problem is understanding you have been GAMBLING and not investing.  Gambling is where you try to guess based on whatever metrics you want to use that you have found stocks that will do better then the market.  Just like with gambling a few do GREAT and most faii/ house wins.  Investing is taking what the market gives as a whole realizing over time the markets have to go up in a capitalistic economy (those who provide capital have to be rewarded or they will stop providing said capital).     The problems are folks get their ""investing"" information from Reddit and other main stream sites from folks who don't know ANY of the data or evidency.  ALL the advice on here is so random and when pressed by folks, like me, to show some published data to support their claims there is only silence.       If you want to know about investing it takes about 1 weekend of light reading. For those interested here are the quick books I recommend... 1.  Jack Bogle's ""Little book on common sense investing"" and 2.  Allen Roth's ""How a second grader beat wall street"".  Then do your self a favor and visit bogleheads website.

[It's true that ""liquidity"" would be altered.  Perhaps that would cause prices to better reflect actual supply and demand.  Notice I didn't address liquidity.  And yet with every example cited those markets (shockingly) exist with less liquidity.  It's fine to have disagreements,. But calling an argument ""retarded"" by attacking a point SPECIFICALLY not raised and not addressing ANY of the cases mentioned is nothing but an ad hominem AND a straw man.  It's best not to call people retards while using two logical fallacies while at the exact same time not addressing ANY of the points raised.   You want to talk liquidity? Fine. The technology exists that there is zero need to have an anachronistic multiday settlement period.  We aren't even using paper shares right now for Christ's sake. There are millions of people and pooled funds all over the world.  Would it reduce retail participation? Perhaps.  But at what cost?  If retail is able to ""participate"" solely due to an infinite obligations warehouse and unmanaged ""share lending"" then is that really participation?  The necessary follow up to that is that prices are NEVER allowed to reflect true supply and demand.  Please get off your high horse of ""LiQuiDiTy""  At best that argument may have been effective in 1950.  A final note:. Let's talk about liquidity.  With the advent of HFT, you know what happens to that liquidity when it's REALLY needed?  Like in 87, 2008 and the flash crash?  All that ""much touted liquidity"" disappears.

I lost probably $500 within a few weeks as I panic sold.  - Then I got in to other speculative stuff. Small loss in crypto. A biotech penny stock that now trades for .67 cents. Most of these I tended to sell down 20-30%.  - A couple spacs. One was an EV company. I sold before it de-spacked for $12 and now it is like $3 lol.   - Then this year I put money in to some growth stocks that have fallen. Disney, AMD, a logistics company called GXO that spun off of trucking company XPO(my only DD was that I see their trucks around everywhere). I‚Äôve sold all of my positions except for AMD and some Apple   I‚Äôve come to the same conclusion as you. I humbly admit I am no better than most at picking individual stocks.

[I have a feeling that as long as GOOG delivers Tuesday some of the market nerves will be allayed - at least for quality growth stocks with great books.  One of the most conservative analysts (Keybanc) just recently raised guidance on earnings... but hair trimmed target price - cause multiples.  Which is fine/expected.  Raising guidance this close to earnings is what's important.  &gt;He's raising estimates for Alphabet's revenue, slightly (to $55.1 billion) and earnings per share (to $24.17 from $22.90), but remains below consensus on both, by about 2%. But KeyBanc's revenue outlook is ""effectively unchanged"" as headwinds from Europe and YouTube are offset by a slightly better forecast in higher-margin Search revenue (12.5% growth this year, and 13.5% for 2023).  &gt;With some more conservative multiples, though, it trims its price target on GOOGL to $3,075 (implying 29% upside).](/r/stocks/comments/uaiybj/this_time_is_really_different_the_market_is_way/i5y7i7y/)

Beth Kindig (who was bullish on NVDA for these reasons exactly and others years ago, too) makes the full case, and 1 trillion may be on the low end: https://io-fund.com/metaverse-economy-nvidia-omniverse  From 2018: https://beth.technology/holding-nvidia-stock-pay-off/  Market cap bias is hard to beat back, but yeah, I foresee many 1 trillion dollar companies soon enough. Too much paper in the global economy for one thing, and low rates to another. It'll find its way to mega caps in trying to balance yield and flight to safety  Future is hard to predict.

[This is all pretty confusing. You are either agreeing with me in your second paragraph, or you appear to think that the fact that being 3x the size (on a market cap basis) of the world's largest automanufacturer (on every other measure, by about 5x) is a ""ridiculous"" undervaluation of the company based on the results of a fiscal year that won't start for 6 months. This is, to put it mildly, retarded. Did you miss a key and mean to write 2022? That would also have been retarded, of course.  The second paragraph is similarly incomprehensible. A car is a mix of distance per fuel, fuel type, interior, exterior, brand, features, speed and general performance, and other like attributes. Tesla is not merely in the ""electric car"" market, where it is about to lose its status as the sole meaningful participant anyway (if you think no other manufacturers will be able to profitably build these at scale, btw, then lol), it is substitute product for existing GMs, Nissans, Fords, and Toyotas, which are absolutely produced at scale, today.  So the point, which you appear to have missed, presumably because you were eating crating during ninth grade english, is that total decimation of its competitors and complete hegemonic dominance is already priced in. It isn't certain, so what you're buying with Tesla stock is a high probability lottery for the price of what the prize would be anyway. The alternative assumes that there is some separate electric vehicles market that not only has no interaction with the gasoline vehicles market, but that is also at least 2x bigger, which is retarded.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vauaca/elon_is_turning_into_cathie_woods_toxic_and/ic71j3n/)

But if you look at investments being made under the new management, the research they do, the amount of capital they have at their disposal for doing this research and making these massive investments.

Like for real, this is a company that is ALREADY profitable and is making insane investments that will pay off in 5-10years.. Most companies that are investing  so much into growth like intel aren't even profitable yet and have negative earnings.

[Not sure why you have so much value-oriented ETF exposure. VOOV should just be VOO and you can drop either XSVM or AVUV, neither of these are prominent ETFs that will get you anything more than what VOO would already get you. If you want value concentration so bad, do it on a sector-by-sector basis. Shop around for some ETFs that give you exposure to energy, utilities, consumer defensive, and financials. You can also do a REIT if you want more conservative income based investments.   Again, ICLN or QCLN - pick one. You don't need two seperate ETFs when they are tracking the same exact category. My personal pick for clean energy is ICLN. If you were to cross-compare the holdings of these ETFs you'd likely find a &gt;95% correlation.   To fix your tech-heavy bias while maintaining tech exposure, you could sell off MSFT, AAPL, INTC, QCOM, and NVDA and just buy VGT, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF which has all of these and more.

[1) Totally get the breakdown and really glad to see you did your homework on the chip industry. Full disclosure, I have NVDA, AMD, QCOM when it comes to chips. I just don‚Äôt believe INTC gets there before others take the market space, but fully understand your reasoning. And agree. You probably bought in dirt cheap range and let it ride for a year or two and if they don‚Äôt deliver, can always reduce position.  2) No worries at all. Always feel free to ask questions. It‚Äôs how we learn. To answer your question, yes I‚Äôm in the data space and cyber security is a major hole in a lot of companies. So unlike Spotify, there is a major need for cyber defense. Hacking, ransomware, digital warfare is rampant is everywhere. We are also moving to a society where computers, cloud space, cloud storage, moving to cloud infrastructure, and etc‚Ä¶will be exponentially increasing. Right now is the early entry point to these, which is why you see valuations high, but these companies are incredibly well run. Full disclosure, I have PANW, ZS, and CRWD.   4) Completely get that point and I‚Äôm in a similar boat. Have taken a position 25% the size I would have normally committed to see how next couple quarters go and will play it by ear. Agree the metaverse play is going to cause issues along with ad revenue and any iOS updates.  5) BRK.B would be a fine add, but I would say that this is probably a space for a stock pick versus an industry ETF pick. XLF gives you exposure to almost all things financial related, but there are others. Only reason I mention this is a company like WFC and BAC directly make more money as interest rates rise as their business models profit more directly than say a Citi. I think Citi is an interesting value play because they were decimated. I‚Äôm personally looking at BAC, GS, JPM, or Citi.](/r/stocks/comments/v5x7w9/need_some_opinions_on_my_portfolio/ibd1a57/)

I also have a large chunk of money in crypto running a proof of stake validator to generate passive income and $12k in DeFi on a layer2 solution farming 3% APY with additional $14k headed to DeFi in the next few days to earn that nice 3% return.

I‚Äôm waiting for the bottom to start falling out of a lot of markets to average in to a position towards market bottom. Meanwhile, I have a small short position on ETH where I‚Äôm playing the downside swing since we‚Äôve been seeing bearish short and mid-term signals. 

I stay away from gold. All it is, is a store of value, which I think will diminish slowly as BTC replaces gold as a stronger and better store of value.

If you wanna find his true buying power just look at what RH shows as his portfolio balance on the main screen at the beginning of his videos minus the portfolio value you find through portfolio diversity calculations. That will equal funds available not in holdings.

You can do the math yourself with your own portfolio to verify the math checks out. You can go through his past videos as well like I did and check the numbers too.

Robinhood calculates its portfolio diversity % on the current holdings while disregarding buying power and money pending in orders. You can do the math on every holding he shows his portfolio diversity % and current market value of the specific holding.

It's a very good way to discover the true value of all current holdings in a portfolio.",positive

[&gt;It's so fucking dumb.  &gt;The idea is basically that there are black swan events that will happen in the future that tank stocks. However, there are also going to be white swan events that boost companies to the moon.  &gt;My strategy is this: buy companies that have the highest likelihood of having white swan events. Because you can't predict a white swan you can't price it in... So if you own a company before a white swan you can make a killing.  &gt;This is critically different from speculation because I'm not putting a price target on anything. I'm not betting on X happening. None of that.   &gt;Now, obviously I'm not just buying random companies. I'm making sure that the companies are financially sound before I actually buy shares--no crazy start ups that don't have a product yet... No Nikola stocks. No Rivian stocks. None of that shit. It has to be a company that's doing well right now.  &gt;So right now my main long-term holdings for my dumb strategy are AMD, TSLA, PLTR, and NVDA.   &gt;I'd say the one with the most potential is pltr because their business model is the most scalable out of all 3 and they do nothing but sign contracts, anyone of which could be a white swan.   &gt;The only downside is waiting.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rqw7pl/i_have_the_dumbest_strategy_when_buying_stocks/hqdap0z/)

[&gt; A mega-cap stock moving like a penny stock isn‚Äôt a sign of a healthy stock market.  And the past few years of extreme bullishness with little downsides was a sign of a healthy market? Nothing about the explosion of values in the past few years has been healthy.  The market recovered the losses from the covid crash in nearly 6 months to the day. Last green day closed on the SPX before the crash was 2/19/20 @ 3386. 08/18/20 It closed at 3389. 6 months while record unemployment and businesses struggling to even operate was still happening.   Before this most recent dump, on 01/04/2022 SPX closed at 4793. So in 1 year and 10 months, we added 41.55% in value to the SPX. Even using yesterdays close, We are at 32.22% up still. That is still a VERY healthy increase for basically 2 years where we saw 2 corrections. You still would have made a very tidy profit just buying and holding SPY.   Nothing about how this market is currently valued is healthy. Valuations are sky high and not a ton of reason for it.   Currently ~20% of the total SPX value is in 5 tickers. AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, &amp; GOOG. Bring that number out to top 10 companies? You add TSLA, NVDA, BRK.B, FB, UNH and are looking at closer to 28%.

"It was interesting to see the relative strength of TSLA against the indexes. I hold AMD and NVDA and those stocks were taking big beatings but TSLA held up quite well during the last month or so (When oil was surging). Not sure if it was funds or algos but someone was buying as oil was going up. 

  
I know this because I trimmed TSLA at 770 to get into NVDA and AMD as they were both falling from their ATH at a similar pace. End of March TSLA up 30% from when I sold it. NVDA up 20% from when I bought it. AMD up 5% from when I bought it.  I Wish I had kept the AMD cash in TSLA lol but it's a small position so no big deal. 

Also TSLA has a lofty P/E but its forward P/E is low (relative to big growth companies). When in the 800's TSLA forward P/E is 75 which is in line with some growth names like AMZN (Back when AMZN was ramping up). Which I believe helped prop up it's share price as the market fell. I think the lowest it fell was 40% from ATH.",positive

If you don't have faith in the stock, you can sell the shares outright in the market, or even sell an ITM call to generate some extra dough on the way out.",positive

[The market these days seems to have plenty of niche bubbles and crashes.  The most notable ones lately have been the high multiple stocks, mostly in the tech sector.  The damage has been colossal this time around.  Paypal is down almost 66% from its high in July.  That's $250B of market cap POOF.  Facebook is down about 45% from its high in September.  That's $400B+ in market cap POOF.  SHOP has lost 61% since \*NOVEMBER\* and over $100B of market cap POOF.  You're talking trillions in total market cap that has been wiped out in the past 6 months.  Obviously the valuations were getting ahead of themselves, but my goodness.  People want to talk about crypto as if it has a major impact on the markets, but the entire crypto global market cap is about $1.8T today.    The NASDAQ100 is down about 18% since Jan 1st.  That's just 100 of the top growth companies, and 18% represents about $3.15T in valuation lost just since January 1st.  Keep in mind that the NASDAQ100 is being buoyed up by monster names like AMZN and AAPL whose earnings were just too good to sell off.    So yeah we've seen huge valuation destruction just since the start of the 2022.  Several times crypto's entire market cap just in the NASDAQ100.  This is a legendary sell-off but it is concentrated in specific names.  It's being masked by companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon whose earnings are just so good that they've been kept afloat.  You also have some sectors like oil &amp; financials doing well due to the inflationary environment.  So this buoys up the S&amp;P500 and once again hides the true damage.  But by and large many investors have gotten slaughtered so far this year and certain portfolios with heavy allocation to small/mid cap tech are easily down 50%+ right now.](/r/stocks/comments/sv1nkm/at_what_point_do_we_start_calling_dozens_of/hxeguiq/)

[I get where your coming from, and framing it this way of incentivizing *investment* makes more sense. However, after the cultural phenomenon of YOLO'ing came into existence, it's clear that having a small account size isn't necessarily going to prevent traders from gambling away their accounts on the riskiest of products.  Now I don't know whether there's a way to 100% confirm this, but doesn't it make more sense that investment oriented traders likely would have gotten much more burned once the dot com bubble burst? AAPL stock lost about 80% of it's value between March 2000 and the end of the year.   Now sure it obviously all worked out for AAPL shareholders in the end, but I have no doubt many who'd been in the stock for some time sold for a loss.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but at the time there was no cultural phenomenon around making the riskiest of trades (YOLO'ing), so I really have some questions about whether day traders suffered so much more than everyone else who would have lived through an 80% annual drop in AAPL stock.](/r/stocks/comments/sv4juq/why_is_pdt_still_a_rule_the_secs_reason_of/hxe1ycd/)

[Oh but you're confusing actual priced in vs people making a joke about it.   Lots of people have been hedging their bets against an eventual rate hike since March 2020 but they knew it wouldn't come in 2020. In that sense the rate hikes are priced in and the shorter time to them actually happening meant further pricing in based on certainty since the end of 2021.   That TSLA will eventually be a huge market participant in their respective industries has also been priced in. All the shorts and put holders have been finding this out the hard way for the past two years.   It's like when you are working and saving and you have no kids but you plan to have 3-5 of them. You probably have that priced in for your retirement so that you know that you won't just be able to quit working tomorrow and exist on your current savings - lots of expenses are certain.    What do you think billion dollar investment funds are doing all day? They aren't sitting at their level 1 trading acess screen and seeing the buy and sell orders at the top. They are pricing in supply chains and commodities prices and government policies. They could have a team of 20 working on 1 stock all year round full time and still be missing pieces. They will however be (mostly correctly) pricing in the next AAPL expansion before you realize it is happening for certain.](/r/stocks/comments/suze4j/there_is_no_such_thing_as_priced_in/hxczh3u/)

Sometimes it can take years of sideways trading before the broader markets recognize the value in a business.  

Palantir has been publicly traded for less than a year.  If the company continues to prove that it can scale its business more like a SAAS provider than a consultancy, I think it is likely that the markets will reward the stock with higher market cap.  Investors need to be patient.  I expect that PLTR‚Äôs gains will play out over a few years, if not a decade or more",positive

[It would be good to get into either PYPL or UPST now or before the stocks dropped on earnings. They weren't bad news really. The companies look good. You're never going to get in at the best level. So it's better to buy in weekly or monthly.   It's too complicated to try and gauge when things should drop. Look at TTD. Ripped for a bit and then posted good earnings, but not great. Dropped and then roared back. So basically at pullbacks I add.   It's an impossible game to pinpoint that X stock shouldn't be valued at Y level. This happens often in the sub where there's like a no way this stock can be worth this much or when the bear market comes these bulls will be in for a wild surprise. But the problem is we're not there yet. So why not embrace it and make money now and later?](/r/stocks/comments/qqeehg/roblox_will_go_down_this_week/hk0vkg3/)

&gt;ou keep going in circles with the ‚Äújoke‚Äù theory

He literally contradicts the colloquial meaning of the word to troll people, no one considers him to be a socialist in any capacity in colloquial meaning

How is this a theory? It's not. It's self evident.

&gt;I would benefit if Musk were supporting TS or Free Speech for Free Speech‚Äôs sake; I‚Äôd love it to be the case, but the skeptic in me cannot look past Musk‚Äôs deep ideological views and the tech he‚Äôs pursued.

This is linear thinking. We are dealing with high level contingencies. You would benefit from believing your current world view is intact that he is not a powerful ally since you also do not believe he is a trustworthy person.

You find it beneficial to your own bias that he is not a good person since you perceive him as competition, but he is not. And even if he was I've laid out numerous amounts of hard research to show his involvement in Twitter would be a PR, financial, political, and economical nightmare. Where is your refutation to any of these points?

If you don't like him, ignore him for now. It's simply not relevant to you since it does not and cannot negatively effect us.

&gt;Tesla would be nonexistent but for the global warming hoax IMHO including the market demand and massive govt subsidies to make it possible.

I've studied greatly that industry from my profession(s) prior to this one.

TSLA is massively successful because it out performs and competes its competitors in areas like torque to weight ratio and 0-60 etc. acceleration, otherwise it would of been successful 5-10 years prior or even prior to that as well.

&gt;we should not all run and fall in love with Musk bc he makes our stock price go a bit higher. He‚Äôs neither necessary nor currently materially significant,

Then why bother making this post at all? Or forcing the point that he is a bad guy on a poorly written article with bad points that no one agrees with.

&gt;ie, Twatter was imploding pre-Musk entry.

Correct. This will be the outcome of Twitter regardless of any scenario that doesn't involve fairy beliefs that there is no deepstate or mindless ideologues who don't care about it. I have thousands of words showing strong evidence of this.

&gt;Rex Tillerson Jeff Sessions Bill Barr Nikki Hailey Mike Pence Need I go on?

TSLA on the other hand could realistically lose 75% of it's value and it might still not be worth it if they can't keep up their ridiculous growth.

 With Amzn I thought they paid no tax or dividends to allow them taking the capital into cloud business really helped to prosper.  With Tesla it was a big gamble.

Selling eV credits and being the first come out with a high end eV.  Again Tsla paid no income tax.    This is based on what I can recall with details missed out.    With Google it was the ads, human love to click so if you buy an ad easily spend $10Ks a month for small business for adwords.

"[Why do you think your semi picks are 'the guys selling the shovels'? I higly doubt it, imo these companies are in no way a safe bet because their product portfolio isn't distinctive and therefore in the semi space they're most likely to fail - that's why they're cheap. It requires a thorough understanding of the sector to invest in these companies.  In my opinion ONTO, COHU, UCTT should be avoided, I don't think they can handle the competitive landscape. LRCX and KLAC might be decent but compared to peers not the best value for your buck imo. Either way bulls should research their product portfolio and how if fits in the market, and for both (or all) I think they'll have to conclude we don't know enough about their potential to justify a long position during the chip wars ahead.  That being said, if the chip wars play out the way we expect today it's likely most of your picks will survive and probably will outperform the market, although underperform in their sector. But I'd consider companies with easier to understand products, like AMAT/AMD/ASML/ASMI/CDNS/MU/NXP/NVDA/INTC/QCOM/WDC - to name a few.

[LIACF ENPH MULN (guessing against Elon) QS  Like u/spannnnn said EV market is actually vast and is a good play. IMO. Not advice. I long for my $600 TSLA shares to come home. Sob.   EV market is limited by what? Production. Take a bet on any company making cars or play the MEME stocks if you want, but only if you want to compete with (bet against) TSLA.   So, What limits EV production? Batteries. Ok. What goes into batteries / supply chains and who is winning that? Find promising Lithium mining or refine companies or other metals that go into batteries (this is where tech and minerals overlap so you can ~diversify). Plenty to choose from DD but think broadly and supply chains. Read their testing purity reports. I chose one with promising reserves not far from Reno‚Äôs gigafactory.   What does the future of EV batteries look like? (I chose a solid state Li company that caught my eye with their patents and tech‚Ä¶.betting on proof and scalability now).  Lots to read about batteries, kind of a long term gamble though on who wins.   Then feeding the vehicle batteries at charging stations. Again guess at a dime a dozen companies that will all change hands (I lost 100% on one trying thy) or go for their materials? Larger batteries and solar to store and charge EVs. There are large companies that do this and could scale to office building size EV charging lots.

NASDAQ:HUGE / 5

[1) I think learning it in this order makes the most sense:  Learn the ""business"" side - risk management, risk of ruin, RR ratio + winrate, P/L, how to record trades + journaling statistics in general.  A lot of DT books don't go deep enough into this subject, but there's some pretty good content on YouTube that isn't hard to find.  This is the business side of everything, and it has to be crystal clear.  If you don't treat the market with the utmost respect, you'll get burned eventually.  Learn the psychology - Learn how a brain makes decisions, both logically AND emotionally.  THIS IS A HUGE REASON WHY PEOPLE BLOW UP ACCOUNTS.  If you can learn the psychology behind revenge trading, chasing, apprehensive trading, etc, you can learn to recognize symptoms instead of being a victim to them.  The Psychology of Trading by Steenbarger is long-winded, but a great read on this topic.  Anything by Mark Douglas is excellent as well.  Learn an edge - Figure out a strategy that works for your personality.  This will take experimentation, practice with a paper account, and gathering statistics to prove to yourself that you've got the hang of it.  Then, begin scaling into trading real positions slowly so that the psychology can take its toll and you can learn to manage the entire process live.  2) Technical Analysis helps, until it doesn't.  Learning to read price action is extremely important because it's how you can read the psychology of the market, and make informed decisions.  Look up u/utilizingtheta and his YouTube channel, Large Cap Day Traders.  He is hyper focused on this aspect of trading and has tons of amazing content accessible for free, as well as some pretty cheap (imo) paid stuff.  I don't get too crazy with TA.  The reason is because I try and keep charting pretty basic, because there's a good chance that a lot of other traders are looking at basic stuff too.  Getting too deep can give you tunnel vision, which could keep you out of touch with the broader market.  The phrase ""can't see the forest through the trees"" comes to mind.](/r/Daytrading/comments/trm3zn/what_is_actually_useful/i2mkmqx/)

[I buy VOO every month with 40% of my income. Whenever I feel anxious about my position, I take a deep breath, a day off and go for a walk/drive around town. When I walkout of the door, a AMZN package I ordered 18 hours ago had already been here, neat. Then I take out my AAPL phone and go to GOOGL to look for a place to eat/chill, just got my PFE vaccine last month so I‚Äôm good to go.

The drive is 5 miles, I wonder why the HDs, COSTs, WMTs, TGTs parking are always packed like that, even tho it‚Äôs only Wednesday,  Hmmm guess I‚Äôll skip groceries today. I feel lazy. Sitting at the restaurant‚Äôs outdoor patio, I enjoy my brunch with a glass of wine, my eyes start wandering around. What a beautiful day, the birds, the air, the people. Maybe it‚Äôs enough wine for the day, I go in to grab a soft drink. 8 out of 10 drinks on the fountain machine are KO products. Lots people around me are working on their AAPL and MSFT laptops. They are so thin yet very powerful. As a tech geek I know they are powered by INTC and AMD CPUs, and the heavy stuffs are done with NVIDIA GPUs. Gosh people are so productive nowadays!

Damn there‚Äôs a line wrapping around that MCD and SBUX drive thru, the food is unhealthy but well business is still booming I guess.

[There is absolutely nothing interesting about their business model, companies have been going out of business with this model since the beginning of online shopping in the 90s.  The difference with Shopify is their stand-out success. But that was already true before the pandemic. No matter how much you love their business model, it hasn't changed in that time frame.  Clients can use a different web host, and a different payment processor. All that end-users care about it that they have trusted CC processing. There is no lock-in that translates into higher rates for them. They've simply done a good job at making clients happy with the services. That's great. But again, it was already true. Stock prices are not expected to go up more than the market every month because a company is great. A company is great, once people decide it is great the price goes up.

Tesla's net income in 2020 was $690M. Their net income in the trailing 3 quarters is $3.2B. They're expected to have done anywhere between $2.4B and $3B. Even taking the worst case, that's $5.6B in 2021, or a 712% growth.

Perhaps you just don't understand what net income means, and you were looking at revenues instead. They did $31.5B revenue in 2021. Even if Q4 is the same as Q3, which is highly unlikely as they sold 28% more cars (over a single quarter!), they'll be at $50B revenue for the full year 2021, or 59% growth.

[I believe options as well as shortselling is a gamble if people use it like that. Ill just say that any form of daytrading should have a proper plan. Its not wrong to get a 0dte Put/call as a lotto pick that can run to zero but usually you should have a trading plan. I enter based on TA and if my theory gets proven wrong I do have my exit points.  Could be as simple as (If you go long for example) break of VWAP/SMA levels/rejection at certain resistance etc pp. Same with shorts where you exit it the stock suddenly gains strength and your theory is wrong.  I absolutely agree that spreads are better. For most people with smaller accounts they limit potential loss (but also gain) but are generally used to grow the account so I think thats nice.  As for margin I personally use it in three terms. One is investment and increase of buying power. Take a bigger position with low margin (or leverage in crypto case) with 2-5x. Be aware of a liquidation zone and exit with a stop before that. Your entry should be low enough that a drop to liquidaton levels is unlikely.  Trading. Going short or long on futures over spot margin with 5x-20x having a set strategy with fixed stop loss or stop market. If your theory is right you can put the stop loss into profit and let it run or have a fixed exit point.  And last gamble money. X50-x100 on futures. Super rare and with very clear entry. Ultra short term trade. Be content to lose that money as its Bet/gamble.  As you might read I do a lot more crypto trading compared to Stocks.  About IBKR and taxes; I swapped to IBKR so I could sell calls against my stock position but I am not around there for a year so I never had to do taxes. Also the market is red so I am red there too üòÖ  If I win big I dont think doing taxes is too terrible but If need be I would just get an Accountant. I used TR before which is nice and convenient but trading US stocks and spreads being 5-20 EU Cents is just stupid.](/r/stocks/comments/utvqa5/buffett_vs_burry_buy_or_sell_apple_stock/i9gbb6d/)

"No worries. All good questions. Thank you for reaching out. Let me try to best address your questions. I like the longer term time frames for all my analysis because it allows to see the longer term theme of the markets. I find that context really valuable as I don‚Äôt want to be fighting the trend on these pattern breakouts. I also find that daily time frame pattern breakouts tend to give you that right pop on breakout and I can get more consistent follow through. That helps me justify the less than ideal spreads on some of these names. I pretty much only day trade. I don‚Äôt hold much overnight. So I just sit and wait for these patterns to trigger and then look to play them. I use the shorter time frames to quantify the relative strength in the run up to the move and then use that info to filter out bad looking setups. 

I trade five core names otherwise. Spy, qqq, appl, tsla, MSFT. And I play those with a 5 or 6 different types of strategies and am happy to play those names with intraday patterns or setups because the option spreads are tight and justifiable",positive

[I know. Since I don't want to write it down in detail, but since I got a minute, I'll detail here. Buckle up.   In theory, unlimited or infinite profit can only happen in stock when it goes up. But if it's always going up, we're bound to inflation. So there must be two ways to make profits. Short strategy was legalized in 1937. But there's a catch. You can only short when the price goes up. You cannot short if the stock price keeps diving, the mechanism that allows to protect company potential and excessive speculation. But we know that over time, it disappears and shorting can be done indefinitely.   In a theory of energy conservation, there's only a constant energy but the energy transforms. If the market is limited with those brokers and market makers, if someone makes a profit, there must be others who lost their money. It's the conservation of money supply in the market. However in order to attract external investment or (DCA for retailer), market makers need to give a little sometimes back to retailers. So retailers or some call it retards here in wsb dump their hourly wages or salary to the market.   If there's a supply, there must be someone raking up those supplies. In a well known case that Goldman Sachs, one of the big IBs always make profits 85% of the time consistently. Remember GS is also one of the market makers (MM). If the economy is down, GS will still make profit. How so? It's because of 2 ways streets that were created even before our grandparents were born, i.e., Shorting.   In 21st century, retailers can easily invest at the tip of their fingers and all the information available in web. What is the advantages that those MM can wield to make profit?   Traditionally, if the company can make $1 per outstanding share, their share is only worth at $1 (Simply saying). Whoever likes to pay more than $1 is banking on the potential of the company profits down the road and profitability of the company in the near future. So PE ratio gets inflated over time.   If the PE ratio is set in stone, retailers have the advantage over MMs or those IBs. One the ratio hits 20, retailers can stop buying shares. But in reality it is not. By making the PE ratio varies between different companies and in different times, MMs hold the ultimate power over retailers when to screw those retards and when to give them a little so that their DCA will keep coming into the market.   That's how IBs, got rich. There's nothing sophisticated about ultra intelligent bankers. They produce nothing. They just create a wave, the wave that most of the retailers cannot predict and only insiders know when to dump, i.e., short or hold the stock.   The rest are just for entertainment purpose, such as price target. Yes, when they want to pump the stock, all IBs, GS, Morgan Stanley, BoA, etc raised the PT so that retailers can be hopeful. Once the PT is reached, dump.   Of course, you'd wonder when they'd be dumping once the price hits the ATH (All time high)? It's the insider tactics. That's why I said earlier, when I talked about this, no one likes to hear it.   What does it to do with TSLA. TSLA is another tulip mania in the US.   To make it short, in order to pump money into something, you need some tangible entity. US keeps complaining about China this and China that, but in reality China is the biggest economy and MADE in CHINA is more common in your home and mine than our official name printed in our houses.   So MM cannot pump their forever darlings stock when in reality those stocks might represents nothing but a piece of paper, eg, Hertz. So they need some darling stocks and TSLA represents a good one.   You know why? SpaceX has a deal with US military. So there's a green light to pump TSLA and include it in SPX within a short span of time. Of course those happens only after Elon SpaceX successfully launched. Otherwise, TSLA will forever be under water.   Of course, you can say this is all pure fantasy or conspiracy.   We all know why Pelosi bought deep ITM TSLA calls way back.   Anyway....](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rntoow/suspicions_about_tsla/hpv9mxq/)

I don‚Äôt even feel comfortable with 2.5 yr DTE options on PLTR based on last years post GME apocalypse event.

"Right, just to make a few points on the incredibly bullish stock split news today, I asked my 1 wrinkled friend to read it for me:

\- WHEN: after approval by shareholder vote 6/9 (nice)

\- Gamestop currently has \~76m shares in issue, and the ability to issue up to 300m. The fact that they are increasing the ability to issue up to 1,000,000,000 shares (1 Billyun) shows that the split they plan is at least 4:1. But what is important, is that the fact a 4:1 or 5:1 split is quite reasonable and normal, but they have asked for an allotment of 1B, means that they may want the ability to do it again in future (ie. the price is gonna be fucking high so they will want to split it again).

\- this is not a reverse split, that would be a consolidation move and would result in less shares at a higher price (the opposite of a split).

\- yes you will still get the split shares if you hold in a broker or CS (look at other splits like TSLA).

\- one reason it's bullish is because it drops the price per share and therefore makes it more attractive to retards who can't understand that it's all about market cap not individual share price.

\- second reason it's bullish is because the stock split being issued by dividend, *I think*, means they will need to do a count/recall - Shorts r fuk.

\- so although not immediately in effect, between now and 6/9 (nice) we are either gonna see shorts mad panic to close, or they are gonna try and fuck us in the ass harder than ever and expect all the tricks to be pulled out (I think the latter is more likely).

\- (Speculation) if the split is issued via dividend then they could also include something else in the issue for long shareholders. This could be a token (IMX/LRC maybe), or it could be an additional 'free' share, or it could be a cash divi (unlikely and pointless). If they said 'everyone holding shares is getting them split 5:1 PLUS one free share' then that just increased the amount of FUK that shorts R by 1/5th.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: DRS is still the most important thing. I think everyone will still get the stock split whether they hold CS or broker shares, but the need to reduce share lending and liquidity is still paramount. DR fucking S.",positive
"Overall

Not investing in TSLA or AMD when I knew I should have. 10 years ago, pre-split, when tesla was hovering around $180/share, everyone was still skeptical of them, and you hardly saw one on the road. When a client of my wife‚Äôs showed up in one, he offered me to drive his, and I was blown away. I knew right then the cars were something special. 

With AMD? I had always kept my eye on the tech sector. During a foray into building my own PC, I was talking with several friends of mine who were much more well-versed in the world about who and what I should use. Scraping a forum, I stumbled across two guys arguing about who would be ahead in the next few years. One of the guys worked for AMD. He pleaded with anyone who would listen to buy into the company (the stock price was $5ish at the time) even if you didn‚Äôt use them in any personal application. His conviction hit those same heart strings with me driving the Model S. I wish I would‚Äôve listened. 

Yet, I was focused on our new marriage and saving for a down payment on a house. I‚Äôll always look back on those two examples as the difference between me working as a wage slave vs retiring early. I know there will always be new opportunities, but these in particular hurt the most nowadays.

Under all 

Knowing when to sell. Set a goal, take profits, and live your life. I‚Äôve held winners far too long, only to watch them plummet into losers. This mostly goes for meme stocks, but it‚Äôs applicable to much more than that.",positive
"I use PEG ratio to value companies as well but their PEG is still too high( I don‚Äôt invest in anything over 1.5) and a bother issue is if their growth estimates decline then your stuck bag holding.

This happened to Netflix. Had high growth estimates the ost few years so it was seen as undervalued then the ER came out and growth expectations declined so now they have gone from undervalued to over valued in one ER with a higher PEG ratio.

The same thing could happen to TSLA.

I like the company but for me it‚Äôs too risky at these prices in this current time period. Ok if you got in much earlier though.",positive
"You're welcome. It was an honest attempt to help because if it were me I'd want someone to do the same. Thanks for being gracious about this correction. You can understand how some people freak out about this stuff. 

Congrats on the awesome new ride. I just sold my Tesla because I'm not driving enough to justify it, but the money's going back to TSLA so it's staying in the family. :)",positive

Lets hope this pltr trade is as good as cathies last tsla trade. 

She sold and TSLA popped. 

It's almost like all of the ark funds are being targeted ... Lol",positive
"Coca Cola and PepsiCo weren't very oversold based on a growth story.  The problem when you buy stocks at inflated valuations, like you did, is you don't provide yourself any margin of safety.  Is it possible that they continue going up?  Certainly!  You provided lots of examples of that. 

Is it also possible that they don't, and you ended up buying at a top that you won't see for another 20 years if ever?  Also yes.

That's one way to invest, and if it works out for you, great!  The issue I personally have with it is you put yourself at an undue level of risk.  There's no floor on the stock price, because almost all of that inflated valuation is based on something that hasn't yet materialized.

Of course, you can and should pay a premium for growth. But what we're seeing with stocks like NVDA and TSLA isn't a premium.  It's speculation, plain and simple.",positive

[I remember my first ever trade. I went down to my local bank to buy some penny stocks in a canadian company that had a medium-sized gold mine in China they were about to start mining. Bank had to get one of their brokers to call a canadian broker to buy the shares for me. Total money invested in stocks: $300. Total brokerage costs: $100. FOR ONE TRADE.  18 months later, Bloody China decides they aren't letting foreigners mine their gold, so the company was sold to a Chinese mining company and some Canadian Judge settled the price to pay to stockholders. I made $4 net profit. It demotivated me, never invested again. Then I saw Lisa Zu become the head of AMD and I got this overpowering gut instinct to invest. I did not. Two years later, the share price was 100x. Oh and I heard about bitcoin back in 2011 when I was listening to libertarian shows like Freedomain Radio (it's a cult, don't go there). I remember installing a bitcoin miner back then, only to disable it because I wanted to protect my 8800GTX.  My advice: just because it is stacked against you doesn't mean you have to fall for the illusion that there is no hope. They can only stack it against you so far, so the rest must be exaggerated to keep you discouraged.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tee0ps/reasons_the_us_stock_market_should_not_scare_you/i0phzfi/)

3) Tesla doesn't have the ""Osborne Effect"" problem of transitioning from crappy ICE products to an awesome replacement

4) Tesla is partially a tech company with sidelines in autonomy, energy, and solar power which have an unknown but positive earnings growth potential (autonomous ride hailing alone could add a zero to the market cap)

NYSE:NET DATE : Fri Nov  5 23:44:42 2021 SUBREDDIT : stocks



[I actually have a completely opposite view.  Because Square fell short of their earnings. The missed revenue and money have to go somewhere in the fintech industry, so PayPal taking a bigger chunk of the revenue is very likely as well unless the entire fintech industry did badly as a whole, which would've been already priced in due to the recent industry sell-off.  Not only that but because of lower expectations and sentiments after Square's bad earnings, it means that the downside is already priced in. Usually, during earnings, earnings from one very similar counterpart will affect the other in the same industry (for example, CLF earnings might affect MT, FSLY and NET would be another example in the past), but in this case, PayPal didn't fell much further after SQ's earning, which proves that it was already largely priced in.  As you have mentioned, it is a lot more likely that even if they miss their earnings, it might rise instead. Let's be honest, for the hate it's getting in this subreddit, one have to admit that they're severely oversold and it was a huge overreaction, a 9 straight red candles with 11 out of 12 days being red isn't normal, especially when SP500 is hitting ATH days after days with the market rallying in general.  Also, I believe they're not going to miss their earning reports due to the recent cryptocurrency huge rally, which PayPal is involved in largely as well.](/r/stocks/comments/qnki3s/paypals_looking_tasty_for_upcoming_earnings_what/hjj4f8d/)

Ability to pivot into other markets and innovate when required is promising. I think AMD will continue to eat into NVDAs GPU space in the PC gaming market.   NVDA no one will beat their AI in the next decade, this is their most. Their data center GPU market is exploding YoY and their vertically integrated design is outstanding. Along with NVDA name another product that tripled its selling price from its MSRP during the pandemic and stayed sold out.

"So your strike price + the price you paid for your options (contract price ) is the price you need to hit ,closer to your expectation date, to break even. And then after your in the ‚ÄúMONEY‚Äù it‚Äôs typically worth $100 extra (contract(s)) every 1.0 the stock goes up AFTER your in the money . But technically and realistically you CAN be far under or out of the money and make money. Depending on the volume of the trading stock. Typically the higher the ‚ÄúOPEN INTEREST‚Äù the better.

"Just quick sense check here, TSLA is at 1.2 trillion market cap. What is it gonna take for you to double your money here? TSLA needs to become the largest company in the world for that to happen. 

More technical approach, TSLA is trading at 138x 2022 P/E ratio (using consensus EPS expectations) which means if you buy into TSLA, you expect to re-coup your capital in 138 years. For that kind of valuation, you are expecting massive growth here. 

What proportion of the world's auto sales will come from TSLA? How does competition from new entrants like Lucid fare? Do you expect Legacy guys like Toyota to sit back and let TSLA eat their market share? 

Point is that, competition is tight and yet valuation is so high. GOOGL might be a better bet at ~28x 2022 P/E and better investment moat (dominant in search and yet to fully monetise youtube).",positive

[&gt;TicToc is serious competitor for YouTube. So is IG, FB, Netflix, Discord, etc‚Ä¶  Have you ever tried searching a video you saw a year ago on tiktok without knowing the exact name and artist? Likewise with IG FB et al? Tik tok et al are just the latest version of the infinite scroll with videos while youtube you can actually look things up on (within the usual limits of the internet). Netflix is completely different for streaming things. If they were able to categorise and make searchable the amount of stuff on youtube then it would be more impressive but video streaming on its own is a relatively well tackled technical challenge.   I don't see any of them as actual competitors to youtube as a video repository and search they're social media sites with a relatively primitive search. I said somewhere else already but think closest competitors to youtube in terms of searching and archiving videos in sophisticated ways and making revenue off the categorised advertising are adult sites.](/r/stocks/comments/qzp6g2/what_is_your_moat_stock/hlrxi11/)

[If it were me, GOOG, FB and ADBE  SE - they increased 500% since pre-covid and lost 500mil last quarter. 170bn+ market cap. I got no problems with the growth, just the valuation and profit.  SHOP - they increased over 200% since pre-covid and made 50mil op income last quarter. Over 200bn market cap. Again no problem with growth but valuation and profit.   People call NVDA overvalued at over 800bn and they 'only' made 3bn last quarter.  Well you'll find many supporters for SE and SHOP which are 1/4 of NVDA's size yet don't make a profit at all, I repeat - almost 200bn company that loses 500mil last quarter.  PYPL growth was just 13% last quarter, for a company above 200bn and over 40PE. With competitors everywhere they turn.  PLTR only grew 35%. You might think 35% is fine, except when you see they've more than doubled since IPO 1 year ago, for a paltry 35% growth. Not to mention they lose bucketloads of cash and their employees are happy to sell you their shares.  SQ barely has any profits as well. Company is worth over 100bn. Revenue growth earlier in the year was inflated by bitcoin revenue (with associated costs just as much as revenue) so really isn't comparable growth. Only 27% growth last quarter.  Why FB, GOOG and ADBE are the safest picks and highest quality on the list?  Maybe FB and GOOG have anti-trust issues.  But their financials are A-grade. The best financials relative to PE you can find on the US market.  FB trading at 23PE for a company that grew revenue by 35%. Always buyback shares and virtually zero debt.   GOOG had a staggering 41% growth and 65bn in revenues (HUGE)  and almost 19bn in profits, healthy balance sheet and also buying back shares. All for 28PE.  ADBE will announce their results next month. They are on the expensive side too, PE fluctuates in the 50s-60s. But it's one of the few highly profitable software companies that's growing. Their growth was just 22% but INTU results of higher growth has people hoping ADBE will also have higher growth.   Market probably thinks companies like SE, SHOP, SQ can turn on huge profits after their growth. I don't think it's that easy. GOOG and FB grew while being extremely profitable. TSLA doesn't spend a cent on marketing whereas these current companies need to spend 20%-50% of revenues on marketing.  Disgusting amounts to gain revenue.   People are bored of GOOG and FB but they're extremely profitable and at the top for a reason. They grow at 20%+ consistently without having to aggressively spend to achieve it.](/r/stocks/comments/qzij09/rstocks_daily_discussion_monday_nov_22_2021/hlmmaid/)

[SHOP latest quarter stats.

If we shrink FB by about 4.5x to see what their figures would look like if FB was SHOP's market cap how they would look side-by-side  revenues 6.45bn (up 35%)  - cost of revenue 1.28bn  gross profit 5.17bn  - operating exp 2.84bn  operating profit 2.31bn  net income 2.04bn  So my problem is the valuation.

"The extreme confidence in the fact that Cathie Woods is wrong is very reminiscent of her call on TSLA a few years back.

Two points:

* Part of Cathie Woods' advantage is her ability to make ""crazy"" contrarian calls. When everyone universally believes something is a bad trade you can bet that trade is generally going to be miss-priced considerably. This is why legendary investors advise buying into fear and selling greed. When fear is high assets are generally mispriced to the downside, and when investors are overly confident assets are generally mispriced to the upside. Now, investors like Buffett and Benjamin Graham would probably advise you buy and hold blue-chip companies with low earnings multiples during these periods, but Cathie invests in growth tech and right now growth tech is historically cheap and universally hated. If there was ever an incredible buying opportunity for these stocks in the last several years, it's probably now. Why? Because now seems to be the absolute worst time to go all in on growth tech. Cathie Wood for all her flaws is the only investor in the market right now with the balls to actually disagree with the sentiment and buy. This is precisely why she won so big in 2020-2021. When everyone thought TSLA was going bankrupt Cathie Wood was getting mocked for saying it was going to $4000.

* Secondly, I really don't think it makes much sense to judge Cathie Wood's performance on a year-by-year basis. She clearly doesn't give a crap about what happens in those kinds of time frames so if she's not investing for returns this year, why judge her on them? The reason I'm pointing this out is because it's entirely possible inflation concerns are gone by the end of the year and the FED begins to ease their hawkish stance. If we're currently overestimating how high inflation will be for the duration of 2022 and then how high it will remain in the years to follow it's possible this whole rotation into value has been an overreaction. Perhaps the FED won't be as aggressive as the market fears and perhaps growth stocks shouldn't be trading at their lowest valuations in years and will actually recover quite well over the next 2-3 years. From 2021-2025 she may not beat the market, but from 2022-2025 there's certainly a chance she will. What we know for sure is that when everyone was buying ARKK at all time highs last year it was a huge mistake. Now it's down 60% and is so hated that everyone is shorting it there is a chance now is the time to buy.

But who knows. Perhaps this is one of the few times this sub will believe something with high conviction and actually be right. Sentiment towards ARKK on this sub called the top quite well. Lets see if we can do it again for the bottom.",positive

If you have a 5 day option and 4 days are normal non event days where its expected to move 2% per day and 1 of those 5 days is earnings where its expected to move 15% then the IV on that option is affected by that 1 earnings day a lot more than a 2 year option where you have 500 trading days at 2% expected moves and just a couple days of 15% event days. Once that event passes, the average drops because its passed. This will be felt a lot more in the 5 day option. This is IV crush. The 2 year option has so many non event days that the average wont be effected much by eps passing.

2-whats most likely happening is your call spread is so deep in the money that you are looking at wide bid/ask. ITM options bid/ask gets a bit wonky.  Selling a call spread is that same as buying a put spread. This is called put-call parity. Look at the corresponding puts. They should give you an idea of how much time value is left.   The TSLA jan24 870-880 put spread lets say for example costs 2.50. That means that to derive what the bid on the call spread you take the width of the spread ($10) and back out the cost of the put spread ($2.50). That leaves you with a bid of 7.50 on the call spread. Now that would mean it should trade for *at least* that but spreads usually trade a bit tigher than screens so i would guess 7.75 is more likely.  Use a limit and walk it down.  You are definitely up from your trade, the way options price just make it hard to see it",positive
"I'm not in the worship phase but I have a very high opinion of Musk because:

\- He's actually doing something positive for the environment

\- He's actually doing something inspiring for the future

\- He is pushing forward technologies and ideas near and dear to me (colonization of other celestial bodies, electric cars, reduced pollution, low cost access to space, etc.)

\- He's an engineers engineer - he designed the first SpaceX rockets himself after reading about rocketry.  That's awesome.

Does he have issues?  Absolutely - but so does everybody else.  And there's no one I've ever met that should they become a billionaire I would think not show at least some of those issues..   myself clearly included.

The gain from TSLA for me was icing on the cake above, but the impression came first which caused me to invest in TSLA -- not the other way around.  

P.S.  I also took a private tour of the Tesla Fremont factory in 2014.  The employees there \*definitely\* worshipped him -- but as a former employee of multiple large corporations (defense and finance) - that's not unusual for C-Suite people, and especially normal vs. founders of those corporations.  It's just the way people are, and it's OK.",positive

"I can also put a dollar amount on their profit: at $5 billion, they are at 200:1 price/earnings. If they were ten times as profitable, they would still be above the average for the S&amp;P 500. If Tesla were, say, a laundromat or a restaurant, I would want to see 5:1 or 10:1 to consider it a reasonable investment. 

At a certain point, you can't say ""well they still have growth opportunities or margin improvements in the future"" and use that to justify the price. You can price future income, and for Tesla, the return on investment as it relates to what the company actually sells is so poor I might as well buy treasury bonds. I don't think that Tesla's success is a surer bet than the United States itself.

I'm not denying that people value the stock at $1 trillion. I'm saying that the reason that is the case is because of pure speculative interest, and $TSLA might as well be any other company's stock, or bond, or tulip bulb.",positive

"So I‚Äôm in the 20:1 club

This sends a message to investors that tesla expects big things with tsla. Doing anything less than 10:1 would single weak expectations

This provides employees with low cost entry into the ESP enriching there lives. Esp doesn‚Äôt allow fractional shares so employees must save up in there pool of money and if the stock climbs higher it may shut out employees from getting those shares.

I think Elons plan includes giving his employees the opportunity to invest in there retirement and make them rich.

Allows a low cost entry for retail investors and also to encourage all ages to start investing

50 dollar meal ? Or 50 dollar stock.

And finally. This might be the last split we need until we hit 10T

So what are the negatives of having 20:1 and are my assumptions wrong ?",positive

"Car companies announce their monthly sales and F has been about expected in terms of sales. GM and TSLA have indicated the chip shortage is getting better slowly but surely. Unlike Tesla and GM, F has new EVs coming out this year and have planned to produce 665k new EVs by the end of next year. The Lighting is the biggest car Ford has launched in a long time and will probably have a release date announced or an announcement of the date of the announcement during earnings if they want to release the Lighting this spring. Ford also has the new Bronco that is getting great reviews and their older Bronco hood problem is finally resolved. They also have the E-Train which is an electric delivery van pretty much. Ford is also expanding Ford+ for EV stuff and other announcments for it are teased for this earnings. They also made $8 billion off of their $500 million Rivian investment just in the last quarter.

NASDAQ:AAPL / 69

[This morning on AAPL was a perfect entry, opened below the 200 with the Q‚Äôs and Spy declining.  The first candle started straight up toward the 20O and I was buying puts as it went up, losing on the P/L at first, stop above the 200.  The second, third candles reversed and I was up $1525 within 5 minutes, then out.  Although I was early, because it continued down.  I knew better too.   Sei La vie.     You should start small at the open, but once you get the hang of it, 75% of the time you can get a great start to your day.

[My suggestion is to try out different styles and strategies on a small account, trading popular stocks like SPY or AAPL up and down until you find what works for you. You can backtest all you like on the weekends but you will learn faster by trading with real money. Why? Cos TA is easy to learn, hard to practice in real life. In real-time trading, traders often lose control of their emotions and do stupid things. You won't know where your shortcomings are until you are in the driver's seat.  TA is not invincible and can be easily obliterated by news. Some stocks have huge movements with news, some do nothing.

I may go all in on AMD at morning support and pick up 5000 shares. Then only hold it for 10 cents.   Also note, I'll build into a position at times if I think the move is coming sooner or later then expected.   Then I'll start peeling profits immediately and try to hold some.   Most moves are only 10 to 40 cents. Sometimes scalping a few other moves.   My risk is complicated but cut down 90 percent then add back in at a lower support.

For people who use a Stocks app to monitor prices, **keep track of Indexes at the top.  S&amp;P500 and NASDAQ are at the top of my Stocks app.**  I also have a ticker for broad International markets and U.S. Bond markets.   

Often, how the market is trading an individual stock has more to do with general macro conditions rather than news about the stock.  

Before looking at how my assets are trading at a particular moment, I always check the indexes first. 

I also look at several other individual stocks with minimal connection to TSLA (no known business relationship, different industrial sector).

"[Edit: TLDR: what u/ev01ution said, there‚Äôs never enough money.  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  I think they just want to cash out while they can still guarantee a relatively high IPO.   This is just my opinion, but the IPO market has been insane the past 2 years. Countless companies raising record capital and some being overvalued. I believe the cycle is winding down, and that this is their last chance to get a higher than normal IPO and cash out (at least for the short term).   Not all of the data below directly relates to Reddit IPO, but they are all intertwined. When the equity market is frothy, SPACS popping off, crypto going bananas, etc, this allows companies to IPO higher. Markets dont like uncertainty. If Russia attacks Ukraine, and lets say threatens European countries to not intervine or they cut their oil/gas (this is all extremely speculative, just trying to create an example) this will have an impact on markets. Could amplify other macro events and markets go lower, then Reddit cannot raise as much at IPO.   My reasoning:  -	S&amp;P 500 is set to end higher this year for the third year in a row. Analysts predict a rally in 2022, but a four year streak has only happened 5 times in the past century -	Fed announcing 3 rate hikes for 2022 -	Crypto/NFT mania seems to be cooling off -	Winter season with Omnicron variant/covid/flu -	S&amp;P and Nasdaq are heavily weighted and being held up by a few tech giants. Look under the hood at all the other companies and their returns -	2021 record year for IPOs and SPACs; see below -	SPAC boom/bust: most SPACs are down since the boom in February. CLOV down 73% YTD, SPCE down 37.7% YTD, OPEN down 40% YTD, SOFI up 20%. ($2.45) YTD -	Recent IPOs: Coinbase down 29% since IPO, Rivian down 25% since IPO, Bumble down 56% since IPO, Robinhood‚Äôs ath after their IPO was $85, is now trading $19.10, Oatly down 64% since IPO, Coursera down 47% since IPO, Lemonade (2020 IPO) down 59% YTD, Beyond (2019 IPO) down 52% YTD, Peloton (2019 IPO) down 71% YTD -	2020 IPO Upstart Holdings up 216% YTD, but has been on a downtrend since hitting all time high in October. Past 3 months is down 54%. I call this out as an example of frothy, since the clip of someone pumping this on CNBC and couldn‚Äôt answer when asked what the company does -	Oil/Gas issues. When oil went negative in 2020, some refineries and pumps were permanetly closed. CNBC and Bloomberg had oil people on who explained this. You cant just quickly reopen/restart them. US crude oil production is projected to return to 2019 levels in 2023. The amount of crude oil processed at US refineries is projected to return to 2019 levels by 2025.   As I previously stated, this is all my opinion. I‚Äôm a complete amateur. I love this stuff and am trying to become a trader at a firm, but realistically I dont know anything and am probably wrong about a lot.

As you can see, with the price at $680 and the average price per share since March 2020 at around $400, the average participant has quite a bit of profit.  
  
2. This number shows the quarter-to-date anchored accumulation/distribution indicator on TrendSpider going red after over a year of being green during the uptrend that started in Fall of 2019. This indicator going red shows selling pressure starting for Tesla after topping out earlier in 2021.  
  
3. This number shows the recent monthly breakout through the resistance trendline since the 2021 highs. As you can see, there is quite a bit of volume at the top of the month of August‚Äôs range shown by the raindrop chart and the volume profile (bulge) at the top of the range. However, it is also important to note that into the end of August, this Raindrop is red which confirms the red monthly candle as well. Anytime you have a red raindrop and red candle, it shows confirmation of a move. On top of this, you can also see a volume shelf forming here which is the gray area pointing out to the right which shows a decent amount of volume building at this current price level and has been a base for price to move up off.  
  
4. This number shows the historical seasonality for Tesla since the IPO in 2010. As you can see, going into September and October, TSLA only has a 36% win rate which is one of the lowest performing months of the year historically. Include this with the red candle and red raindrop, it may be worth having a cautious approach into the coming months.",positive

"&gt;""Tesla is losing money on every car they produce"" say the people who look at the overall numbers rather than the margins on each car produced, thus conflating capital expenditure with operational expenditure, and confusing cost per unit with overall business expenses divided by units produced.

Bud, that's the weirdest and most confusing response I've read in awhile.  Are you trying to claim that I said Tesla vehicles were losing money?  I said the exact opposite, noting that Tesla's gross vehicle margin is 23%.  Exact quote:

&gt;In other words, that magical 23%+ margin Tesla touts for their vehicles is not only being subsidized through lucrative government credits and ZEV credits, it's also being subsidized through loses or break even in their battery storage product sales.

That says Tesla is reporting a profit on their vehicle margins... with added reasoning of how they're managing to get such high margins.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If a stationary storage project wasn't profitable, why would Tesla build it?

I actually said it was taking a small loss or breaking even, and possibly making a small profit.  Again, exact quote from my original comment:

&gt;Tesla may lose a bit of money or make a small profit on these sales, but since over ordering lowered the overall price of their cells, it drives up their vehicle margins, more than making up for the loss.

They would build them for the exact reason I mentioned in my original comment; to get rid of cell inventory that they can't use.

&amp;#x200B;

You seem to have missed the pretty critical point in my original comment that mentioned Tesla is over-ordering cells in order to get better prices from their suppliers, leaving them with a surplus of cells after building every car they can.  The lion's share of these cells go into their cars, which generate higher margins for each unit sold, and those lower cell prices help increase the vehicle margins.

Since they can't build cars fast enough, they have to get rid of the excess cells through stationary storage products, or else they'd need to let the cell inventory continuously build.  If they break or take a small loss by selling the cells instead, this tactic costs them next to nothing while benefiting their car division.

Based on their last 10-Q, their energy division saw revenues of $806 million in Q3, and cost of revenues of $803 million.  A $3 million profit is so small that I would consider this breaking even.  Throw in operating expenses, and they're still losing money in their energy division.  Almost all of their gross profit came from their vehicle division according to their 10-Q.

[TSMC. UMC, might also benefit, by picking up TSMC's overflow. I think foundaries are the best long-term exposure to semiconductors. They don't carry as much risk, either. They won't be liable for performance issues, security flaws, inventory delays, and R&amp;D exposure.   This is a similar situation to the steel tariffs, a few years back. The knee-jerk reaction was to buy stock in steel producers. What really happened was raw materials providers gouged steel producers, trimming margins, despite record revenues. This is how Cleveland Cliffs got the money to buy out AK, ArcelorMittal, etc. I think the same fundamental scenario plays out in semiconductors over the next several years.](/r/StockMarket/comments/pldsgf/semiconductorchip_industry_where_do_you_see_the/hcaq76z/)

[I've struggled with this a lot too. For me, I absolutely would be higher up lifetime if I just bought and hold everything I had in 2017 - I had bought SHOP, NVDA, FB, AMD, all at their absolute lows with perfect entries, but sold those for \~15% gains a day or two later. Those are all like 10-20 baggers.  Some of those I got shaken out of -&gt; I read a Citron short report and took it too seriously, etc, but I could've just held them with more patience.  My perspective now is, ***we SHOULD invest in a way that aligns with your personality/psychology.***  I hit 3 20-100%'ers the last two weeks alone holding the stocks for a grand total of 0 minutes  during market hours -&gt; meaning I only held them aftermarket and sold them premarket the next day.  My logic is:  1. I don't need to catch Tesla or Amazon or Shopify, when I can consistently catch specific days' runners or overnighters throughout the whole year. 2. But I do need to *reduce my mistakes.* Understand what trades failed and why. Like going into PROG in \~August when it should've been clear they were running out of cash -&gt; the same trade 2 weeks later is a 5 bagger.  It is totally fine to be short-term and take profits too early when your trades are hitting 5-20% in a one day-two week timeframe.  I just have to always be learning and just pull one more small insight out of the available information, out of the company's ir site, out of their financials, understanding some weird note purchase agreement, what kind of firms are interested and impacting a specific co, how their revolving door of credit works etc.  I do trade the same things you do - I'd add that I still do a lot of DD on them even on short-term holds. Getting sense of the valuation, the state of the float, short interest and short share availability, what the market is interested in etc. I've done 2+ hours reading for stocks I held for literally zero minutes during regular market hours.](/r/stocks/comments/qlotrn/i_cant_get_the_hang_of_letting_my_winners_run/hj8jur6/)

Furthermore, Shankar was recently asked about how the Wejo partnership will benefit investors and he completely disregarded it and just started talking about Wejo's vision. Its like he did not even acknowledge us. That is very different from I am used to, since on earnings calls, the management typically tries to ""promote""  their company to investors.

[Ahh I see the disconnect, I was speaking from a perspective of the rights of a share holder. Do you make the same profits. Do you get voting power etc. I guess as far as shares being loaned, if you cash account and then turn off the loan ability you could in theory diamond hand with a group to make your actions useful.  But the fact is every stock in the market could be shorted at 100's% more than they are based off the loan system as proven by game stop going way above the 100% short ratio.   So I guess I don't understand the value of limiting your ability to get maximum investment on what you trust when their is no actual value produced.   Now with that said the value would be is if you got over 50% of diamond handers to not share and go cash account and they denied dilution and you then add this to the resume, I could see it helping the perception of a Diamond handed stock.   Just know the stuff you hear about synthetic shares from the reddit GME and AMC community is BS. AMC is the only stock owned more than 51% by retail and denying dilution votes.

"[*This is a weekly candle chart of AAPL looking back since September of 2020. This chart goes over different features on the TrendSpider platform that help create a unique experience when doing analysis in the markets both on the technical and non-technical side of things. The technical tools used in this case study focus on using ‚Äúmargin of error‚Äù around different technical levels and using historical seasonality as well as analyst sentiment to look at the non-technical view of Apple.*      1. This number shows the anchor point for the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) in May of 2021. This was a point at which a low was put in and a new pivot at the support zone was created. In this case, you can see that there are two lines associated with the anchored VWAP. One of these lines is the actual anchored VWAP and the other line below it is a 2.5% offset which captures some of the wicks below the original anchored VWAP to account for some of the margin of error that occurs around technical levels.      2. This number shows the trend ‚Äúzone‚Äù which also creates an area of potential support rather than an exact trendline and an exact price. The market rarely respects technical levels perfectly which is why highlighting ‚Äúzones‚Äù of interest rather than exact levels gives traders some margin of error when doing technical analysis.      3. This number shows the historical seasonality for AAPL over the last 13 years which is a measurement since the 2009 financial crisis lows. As you can see, October is the second strong month of the year since 2009 with a 75% win rate. However, going into the end of the year in November and December, that win rate drops down to 58%. A ‚Äúwin rate‚Äù when looking at seasonality on TrendSpider is just measuring how many times a particular period (in this case, months) closed higher than the previous period. In this case, a 75% win rate for October means that October has closed higher than September‚Äôs monthly close 75% of the time since 2009.      4. This number shows the analyst estimates for AAPL over the last year. In this case, you can see that analysts are very bullish on AAPL over the last year with 48 ‚Äúbuy‚Äù ratings, 10 ‚Äúhold‚Äù ratings, and only 1 ‚Äúsell‚Äù rating. This analyst estimates tool on the platform gives you a non-technical view of stocks by seeing the sentiment of professional analysts in the market. In this case, a recent bounce off the anchored VWAP support, bounce off trend zone support, a win rate higher than 50% into November and December, and strong analyst ratings suggest AAPL may be bullish into the end of 2021.](/r/Daytrading/comments/qbbkxj/aapl_weekly_chart_trend_zones_anchored_vwap/hh8b4rb/)

[I am having the same dilemma. I starting buying PINS at IPO ~$26 and then doubled down when it dropped to $14 in 2020. I saw massive gains through the spring of 2021, but the last two quarters have had me worrying about management's competence. The Paypal debacle is the most recent example of actions by management hurting shareholders.   My biggest beef is they are failing at telling the growth story of Pinterest. Analysts are valuing it in the same way that they value Twitter and SNAP, and the platform is nothing like those two companies.    Currently, I am going to hold through earnings next Thursday. If the stock gets slaughtered again like it has the last two calls, and management sounds confused or clueless, I am taking whatever profits I have left and cashing out. I hate to do it, because I think it's a unique platform that isn't easily replicated, and they have a sticky userbase, but if management can't deliver, I will look for better investment opportunities.     PINS could very well get acquired by someone down the line, but I don't want to sit here and wait for that to happen.

With a new CFO on board and focusing on bringing new products, user growths, and beating analyst expectations, WISH can be similar to SNAP stock two years ago or even ESTY stock and Revolve Group.

"Think or swim has it, it's certainly not ideal but it works if you're in a pinch. I use em sometimes if I decide to go for a flip on a break from work or something. The issue is the spread, if you're working with a small range where it's either profit 20 or lose 20 on something that trades a lot it sucks, you'll probably just lose 20. If you're already up let's say 100$ and set a .5 stop loss it's better because it gives you some room, buy remember a .5 stop loss means you could get filled at -.7 due to bid/ask spread. There's only 2 times I actually like to use them.. if I day trade something crazy like TSLA options, sometimes that sucker moves so quick it'll blow past while you're trying to limit sell. Even in that situation it's not good unless you are already in a good profit, because it's so volatile it will trigger your trail pretty easily. I would say it works pretty well on highly popular, super liquid, tight spread big names that aren't super volatile(non meme big name stocks). Spreads are usually .5-.10, constantly being traded, which cuts down on the spread pain and the low bid slippage.",positive

"So truthfully, Bitcoin as a pair is in the dumps at 42k, but its support with TSLA and Microstrategy is right around 40k. Lets call +/-5% 40k the bottom of Bitcoin for sake of argument.

That means we're near the lowest our pair can be unless the bottom completely drops out of Crypto and takes a couple of Fortune 500's with it. If that's the case, we're near the bottom of price discovery.

That means any good news will send it *very good*, as evidenced by the Full Stochastics and MACD being at the bottom of their ranges.

In just the last year I have seen like a thousand people leave a comment almost exactly like this.  I'm not against BB.  I don't have a position either way with them.  I'm skeptical of their ability to compete in the cyber security software market especially without rebranding.  I think of the VP of IT where I work - would he see ""Blackberry"" and think ""now there's a good choice for cyber security!"" or would he think ""That the same company that made the phones I had 10 years ago and totally shit the smart phone market bed by not investing in an app market?""    I don't know what that man thinks.  I don't know if anyone does.  Maybe he would choose BB.  Maybe BB will make killer security software.    But in general this company seems to have a hard time not turning $1 into &lt; $1.   I'll admit that I haven't read much into what they are doing with IoT so I will do that before I say never to buying BB.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rafgfj/bb_blackberry_is_ready_to_launch_list_of_upcoming/hnjrqpx/)

"Happens to all of us, daily. We never learn. I'm now started to get into long term positions, slow and steady.

There will be times u sell and it goes up again and you'll kill yourself. But it's better to lock in $50 gain than to see it go down -$100 and then recover to -$20 and say, oh well I only lose $20.

"[There's a legit investing lesson here. I used to say that Robinhood had a well designed app UI, but a terrible back end infrastructure. Meanwhile, Vanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab have great back end infrastructure, but terrible, outdated UIs. I used to think what those companies did was the hard part, and Robinhood just put some paint on a pig. I joked it was a race to see who could fix themselves up faster. But it's been almost a year, and those old school websites are as bad as ever.  Vanguard's bad UI is somewhat on purpose, and Schwab bought TDA and Thinkorswim. But Fidelity is an embarrassment. Active Trader Pro is the single oldest and worst performing piece of software I've had the misfortune of interacting with in the past decade. Their mobile app is terrible as well, though I commend them for trying to introduce a nicer looking, but still barely functional Robinhood knockoff beta.  Basically, good design is priceless. But since an investor's job is to put a price on things, I'll just say it's very valuable. Haters always said that Steve Jobs was just the pretty boy frontman, but there are a lot of computer companies and only one is the largest corporation on the planet by simply coasting on Jobs's designs. It's hard to write good code or build a brokerage, but it's almost impossible to create good design.

[Sure but there's examples of very long term failures to reach new highs, coupled with periods of high inflation in between, soooo even when it reached the old highs, it didn't buy you as much..  Notable examples:  1929 to 1954 - no new highs, high inflation in the 40s during WW2 especially and after due to shortages  1968 to 1982 - no new highs, market kinda went side ways but with several 40 - 50% drops, during the late 70s especially stocks were considered dead money - high inflation period so when stocks eventually took out the 1968 high they were no where close to the actual 1968 buying power, that was likely not achieved until the mid-late 80s. Also, interest rates were so high in the 70s and early 80s normal folks like most of us became forced sellers to fund our lives and definitely weren't buying stocks in 1980 when it was finally almost over seeing as bonds were yielding 14 - 20%... Also the 80s rally which really started the secular bull market which is now ending was highly manipulated thanks to Reagan tax cuts America could not afford which led to the now untenable debt levels and why the Fed will try to fight inflation but either fail or, absolutely destroy America's economy if they're successful because the government can't afford 7 - 10%+ interest rates without massive tax increases on everyone, and budget cuts too, and government spending makes up for like 20% of usa economy or something so them cutting spending whilst also taking more from workers will be a double whammy.   Nasdaq 2000 to 2015 - 80-90% drop, many companies went totally bankrupt, a few winners in the long run which everyone here pretends they'd probably have been invested in and held for 20 years like Amazon and gotten super rich off but more than likely Nortel woulda been the beloved stock on here over the Amazon book store... Also a fair bit of inflation in those 15 years but not terrible.. But house prices certainly went up and also many people lost everything in 2008 - 2011 so even if they did hold their Nasdaq stocks like Amazon til then, they were likely sellers in 2008 near the lows in order to keep their homes.  So ya, sure, stocks always seem to reach new highs but a lot of that is financial engineering, ignoring the fact that inflation exists especially a lot in things normal people need to buy like energy, food, housing and sone companies outright fail if you have any ""speculative growth stocks"" you hold, well they're the most likely failures... (it is why they're all down 75% whilst overall market is currently down just 20% and I say ""just"" because 20% isn't much of a drop especially considering the abysmal economy and geopolitical situation and famine on the way and the great resignation happening.. It's going way lower eventually.. There will be big bounces along the way, 20%+, all designed to kerp y'all invested and suck in more suckers, whilst all it is is shorts covering making real money and then re-entering their shorts at the top of each rally whilst ppl on here will be most convinced that we've reached a permanent low and go all in, months or years before the real final low.   And this time the Fed doesn't have investors backs, unlike the last 13 year (could really go back 30+ years...) fake as hell bull market with rates at 0% for 13 years and REAL RATES currently at negative 8%... But I'm sure this is all just good and normal and sustainable and literally everyone will be rich soon! (because I don't know anyone who isn't tossing ridiculous sums of money into the market expecting to be super rich really soon so they can quit their jobs en masse and just be traders rest of their lives, doesn't sound like a massive unsustainable bubble at all!)](/r/stocks/comments/uvcwuc/im_selling_everything_rstocks_may_2022/i9omitu/)

Agree. Nothing against TSLA. But their Twitter band and Twitstocks is pure bonkers cult.,positive
"I think the uniqueness of PLTR absolutely makes it a candidate for the trillion club. Aside from being entrenched in government business - basically that is their personal guaranteed revenue growth every year. We know that government likes to spend especially in any advancement for military. That is number 1, the other sub part is the level of access of government data they have is top 3. I noted it that down as one of the key parts to their success. What that data access is I have no idea, but I'm sure it only gives them global knowledge that few know about which drives their software development to new heights.

The second part is they are still very new to offering their services to other companies. Their recent reports showed that while they did have a decline in number of companies they acquired, but the individual spending's have gone up per customer. Means the ones that tried them out, bailed, but the ones that stayed truly saw their value. That is a huge sign IMO.

To answer your question what does far future mean. I have no clue lol, I don't know and can't predict what is going to happen, but the fundamentals of what PLTR offers and has is so unique makes me want to invest into this company for the long term.

Looking at TSLA as an example as that is my second largest holding now. It took them from 2010 - 2017 to 20x their initial value - but this is really different comparison as PLTR has had a much longer history than TSLA. If I were to have a number in my mind I think PLTR could easily 5 - 8X in the next 5 years. From there it could take another 5 - 10 to reach that trillion mark. All together could be looking at the next 15-20 years to reach that mark.

What are your thoughts on timeline?",positive

I never claimed that the amount of electric cars won't increase. I never claimed that EVs are doomed to fail.

However, people like you don't seem to (want to) understand that value matters even if you believe in both the company and the market sector. And if you claim that TSLA at $900 is a buy on a fundamental basis and you expect returns that exceed the average historical market performance, you'd have to assume that TSLAs revenue will be far, far bigger than the ENTIRE global market is today, which is nuts. Sure, the market will grow, but the automotive market isn't a new sector either. And TSLA will not be the only player in that market. Now even if you believe in perfect execution regarding the autonomous taxi network (and if you invest on fundamentals, you want to make conservative assumptions rather than assuming perfect execution) TSLA realistically won't get to those numbers. What's more, as companies grow, growth slows down and valuations moderate. 

So yes. There is absolutely no fundamental justification to buy TSLA at the current price.",positive
"I am like 9 years younger butttttttt I realized I was looking for external things to motivate me to do things. but more recently I've found how to motivate myself to do things for myself. and idk how long it will last but it feels good to do things for myself anddd by doing things for myself and feeling good I do more things for myself. but I feel like one bad relationship could totally break me again (skull emoji). but I have been through a lot and that totally broke me down and pushed me over the edge XD. fun times. but idk just focusing on taking care of myself seems to make things better. I too am unemployed atm but I recently applied for a job so hopefully I get it. About a year ago I had a job but I just couldn't do it anymore. Despite giving it all my effort my body couldn't keep up any longer. and then I got upset because I tried my best but then my body was just like nah. and I had to retire early from that job- or that's what I call it anyways. hehe. back then I had no reason to keep the job. No true reason. The first job I got was so I could take care of my girlfriend and do cute dates. well she ended up ghosting me and dating another dude LOL. and then a few months after that happened I retired. But now my reason for working is for me. For myself. So I can eat healthier and take care of my mental state and pay for doctor visits. And if I get this job I will see it as a side job because it will not pay the bills PERIOD QUEEN. I will do that job and if I am not burnt out from that I will start putting money into an IRA and investing some more into tsla and I might try to start an online store and a brand. and YT channel. a lot of my dreams are dead. but I have kept these ones safe. I just realize that no one else will look out for me like how I will look out for me. And I want me to be happy. sooo I gotta make me happy. even if it's not exactly anything close to what I expected or wanted at this point in my life. but life just seems to be this way. and honestly, odds are everyone of those things I mentioned will fail. but that's life ig. kinda like how my grandpa's lungs just failed to work and he died. things fail alll da time. especially businesses.",positive

[I think SPY can reasonably keep growing for the next 40 years and beyond (though not without hiccups), and possibly the same with MSFT and AAPL.  That said, as you get closer to retirement you tend to be more risk-averse since you don't want to be holding SPY if it corrects down significantly, as if it does you never know how long it will take to recoup its losses. A 30 year old won't care, because SPY will almost certainly recover well before he retires, but a 70 year wouldn't like to see 20-30% of his retirement fund get wiped out during a correction.  There's a thing called a target retirement fund that automatically rebalances your portfolio from stocks to bonds the closer you get to retirement.  God only knows what will happen in the bond market in 40 years, but another alternative would be to convert your high-flyers or SPY into blue-chip dividend stocks like Coca Cola, if they're still around (surely they will be).   In summary, if you're young you don't need to worry much about SPY, but could reconsider rebalancing more conservatively as you approach retirement. The same probably goes for MSFT, AAPL, etc., but as individual companies you do want to keep a closer eye on them since there's more concentrated risk there.   Even moreso if it's a speculative stock rather than a strong name like either of those two.](/r/stocks/comments/p81r65/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_aug/h9psg0t/)

[So I really like GitLab as a company and work with them pretty frequently. If I had to bet, I would say that they are going to continue crushing the market. However, I think the stock is wayyyy overvalued.  They've got a market cap of roughly $14 billion and they'll probably do $210M - $220M in sales this year. If we say that sales = revenue (it isn't), their P/E ratio is 63. That's actually higher than one of their competitors Atlassian, who sits around 50. Atlassian's Git product BitBucket is nowhere near as good at GitLab, but Jira is literally everywhere. GitLab's closest competitor is GitHub, owned by Microsoft. Microsoft's PE ratio is in the high 30s but not a great comparison. At least 63 isn't anywhere near as bad as TSLA which sits at &gt; 400.  GitLab is losing a ton of money (last year they lost about $200M). Luckily they raised about $800M from the IPO which gives them a few years of runway. My expectation is they will scale engineering and sales to keep up with GitHub.  GitHub is extremely strong competition, but not for reasons people typically mention. GitHub is the defacto git repo for almost all open source software. However, they initially neglected the enterprise customers so GitLab has taken a lot of those accounts. In addition, GitLab's CI capabilities are a solid 1.5-2 years ahead of GitHub's.  However... GitHub, owned by Microsoft, has more money than you can imagine. Microsoft's strategy is to give their customers that pay for TFS/Visual Studio free GitHub licenses. In addition, Microsoft will give customers hundreds of thousands of dollars in free consulting to help migrate over.   GitHub also has a $5/user/month tier. GitLab did away with that tier a year ago because it is unprofitable. Microsoft has so much money, they are currently using those very cheap licenses for more user acquisition. Plus, pretty much every company is a Microsoft customer already so the sales reps have tons of inroads. In addition, Microsoft owns LinkedIn. That means Microsoft knows who works at what company, how to reach them, the skills of the company's employees, and what platforms they use (e.g., if a company has 30 enterprise software engineers for SAP, well, MSFT knows they do a lot of SAP work). That information is extremely valuable to sellers.](/r/stocks/comments/q8a0yt/gitlab_ipo_what_are_your_thoughts_worth_buying_or/hgobnl4/)

"I'm 36 and on a similar path career and wealth-wise.

Problems are always easier when they're not yours so maybe my two cents can help.

Take little incremental steps towards happiness.

What do you like?  What are you interested in?  A hobby with a community could add zest into your life.  Start online, it could lead to real life friendships.

Take your wife on dates and show you want to make things great.   Rekindle the thing that made you fall for her in the first place.  Even as simple as taking her out to eat at the location of your first date, or kiss, or whatever.  Put work into the relationship.

Don't underestimate the value of going out of your way for others, especially your spouse.  No one gives a shit about anyone anymore.  No one talks to anyone in line at the store.  Little acts of kindness go a LONG way, now more than ever.  Just the idea of someone thinking about you, acting on it, and devoting time to you gives an amazing feeling.  As a 30-something guy I feel completely invisible to everyone around me 99% of the time.

I personally oscillate between extreme cynic and extreme optimist.  I think holding $700k cash isn't the right move if you're afraid of WW3.  There's too much counter-party risk with holding cash.  Your cash isn't going to go far (or anywhere) when everyone is rushing to buy peanut butter and gasoline or if hyper inflation hits.  Money was worthless on the Titanic when it was sinking.  If WW3 is a concern (which is reasonable to an extent), I would keep non-perishable stock of food in the house that would be enough to last you several months.  The day before people freaked out during the initial COVID wave, I bought 4 giant tubs of peanut butter just in case which made me feel better.

I also invested in solar panels with battery storage.  My system is a bit oversized on the solar side (15KW for a 1200sqft house, with two Tesla powerwalls).  Going with as many solar panels as you can will make you capable of being off grid somewhat indefinitely.  You might need to shed loads (not run A/C) on cloudy days but it beats waiting on line for gasoline for a temporary generator or depending on natural gas for a permanent generator.  On top of that, after incentives (at least in NY), the system pays for itself in 4-5 years when you factor in that savings aren't taxed.

I'm neutral on guns but I've considered getting a shotgun just in case there's civil unrest to deter anyone from taking my peanut butter and solar panels.

I've always been frugal but I've eased up lately.  I still spend less than $100K/yr in a HCOL area.  I had a windfall on $TSLA stock so I splurged and got a Tesla.  Lots of fun, even though it's just a car.  Cool not needing gas.  It's novel.  What's the point of life if you don't enjoy it?  I do limit myself to things which I consider durable goods.  I don't mind spending $5K on a computer but to spend $20 on a cocktail would kill me.

Personally, I have lots of hobbies I can fall back on.  My guitars, music, computers, audio gear, woodworking, home automation, etc.  If you have those, great pick one and get into it.  Don't let yourself be too isolated.",positive

"Like others have stated - selling covered calls is not that complex to execute or understand. The way I explain it:

You are doing a short term rental of a property you own - kinda like Airbnb for stocks. It is not just a rental contract - it is a rent to own short term contract - you may get you property called from you at the assigned strike price...

My advice is to spend 95% of your research and training time on how to invest in stocks - not all the complex options strategies. In the end - regardless of how you use options - It's picking the right stocks, staying diversified, etc - this is what will help you make $$ in the market...

I have not used TD before - but I have heard very good things about that platform - I would use it...

I run a fund with about 20 stocks in it. I use the wheel strategy to generate income. The wheel is simple - I sell calls on stock I own, and sell puts on stock I want to include in my wheelhouse...

Currently I have the following in my Fund - MU, PLTR, STLD, C, WFC, AR, BMBL, CSIQ, FSLR, TSLA, ZEUS, LRCX, etc...

"[Leading stocks generally stall / fall because valuations and growth expectations were too high, not because they stopped growing or got smaller.  For example, if you look at the operating margins of tech companies today they're insane. This is the real the reason why tech dominates. It doesn't matter if you're a car company, a phone company or a cloud company, if you have crazy margins and decent growth at scale you'll be at the top of the indexes. For large companies which can't grow revenue as effectively anymore, margins are really all that matters. The question you should be asking isn't whether a company like GOOG will be bigger in a decade, but where their margins are heading. If a company's margins contract by 50% they would need 100% revenue growth to make up for this. And the problem for the mega caps is that they're so large doubling in size isn't easy anymore.  It's just a fact that as companies grow old they tend to become bloated and less efficient. Margins always begin to flatten out, as does growth. But times continue to change and technology continues to evolve... Smaller, more nimble startup companies will continue to hop onto new trends that are at overlooked by the larger companies (EVs, bitcoin, the internet, etc). Most of these startup companies will fail, but a few will stumble onto something revolutionary and experience the rapid growth and high margins associated with this new industry. As time goes on the older mega-cap tech companies will continue to see slower growth and their margins will begin to fall, both from increased competition and from bloat. As margins and growth falls, so do their elevated valuations. Slowly the innovative companies rise to take their place and go on to dominate for a decade or two before also beginning their slow decline. A company like AMZN might always be around, but in a decade or two it might look more like IBM does today -- still relevant, but not like it was in the past.  In my opinion FB is quite likely to be a smaller company in a decade's time. AAPL potentially could be too. I think there is still a lot of growth left in cloud names (MSFT &amp; AMZN) and I don't see Google slowing anytime soon, but it would be a mistake to believe big tech companies will grow and continue to expand margins forever. Both MSFT and AMZN are huge companies and trade at significant premiums to the market. Should their margins drop and growth slow these companies could struggle to ever reach their COVID hype highs. People thought companies like CSCO were the future in the 90s. Arguably INTC is another darling from a couple of decades ago that is now dying after having a good run.  Just don't underestimate what can change in a decade. When I think back a decade ago FB was loved by everyone. Now it seems kind of crazy to think people were actually interested enough in FB that they would make a movie about FB and Zuckerberg. But back then Zuckerberg was kind of seen as Elon is today, and hardly anyone one knew who Elon was in the early 2010s. Things will almost certainly change in ways you can't even imagine in a decades time. Big tech companies may be the future, but who knows who will be the big tech players of the next decade.](/r/stocks/comments/u1hvsq/realistically_where_do_you_see_the_stock_market/i4d0cse/)

"I believe that this run up was just a bit delayed price increase after merger. Right now Rocket lab has insane valuation comparing with Tesla or Lemonade for example. 

I like to compare growth stocks by revenue to market cap. I know it's not quite right, but I just like to do that to get a ""feeling"" of the valuation.

2021 projected turnover to market cap (divided):
- RKLB ratio 130 (15.88$ price, 7.11B cap, 55m projected revenue)
- TSLA ratio 13 (731$, 723B cap, around 55B projected revenue)
- LMND ratio 37 (73.03$, 4.49B cap, around 120m )

Of course other space stocks are much more overvalued, but that valuation is basically 100% hype. So in this sense you can compare the hype - maybe, but looking at google trends, comparing Rocket Lab with Virgin Galactic - the later has much higher search volume still, so theoretically SPCE has bigger hype.  

So overall, I believe that rocket lab will go much lower and will not come back to the 20$ plus for some time. But lets see. I'm waiting for the price movement to stabilize. If the opportunity will present itself, Im jumping back. But not now. At least for few feeks.",positive

[Nobody has broke it down in layman‚Äôs terms so let me try. Here‚Äôs how I think it works. Say you trade Tesla every day and lose $100k in 2021 and continue to trade it every day in 2022 (or at least once up to Jan 31 2022). Say you trade Apple and earn $150k and do the same thing. At the end of 2021 you think you are up $50k but that‚Äôs not how the tax man sees it.  The IRS will only recognize $3k per year until the loss is satisfied and will show $147k in profits and expect taxes on then$147k.   Here‚Äôs another example. Say you traded NVDA in 2021 and lost $200k and kept trading NVDA. Say you earned $200k on AMD in 2021. Your balance shows $0 for a break even. You can only recognize $3k in losses from NVDA so even though your balance shows break even you owe taxes on $197k.    Bottom line is go a 30 day period without trading a stock you are expecting to claim an offset loss on around Dec 31.   This is what was explained to me.  Keep in mind if you have multiple trading accounts it it your responsibility to know if you‚Äôve traded those stocks across multiple accounts. Your 1099 will not show what happens across accounts.](/r/Daytrading/comments/swlt28/i_took_a_loss_of_150k_this_year_and_i_owe_75k_to/hxo037h/)

[Then I did everything right like hundreds of thousands of other people by buying NVDA last week before the 4th quarter report. But you may find a solid reason why it was a mistake in the first place for me or anyone to buy it last week. At $264 which was the price many many others bought it too at some point last week.  I'm not trying to troll you. Just lay it on me, I can take the constructive criticism why I should not have bought it. Some already said it was overvalued and people should have noticed that first before buying it last week even though it had a great 4th quarter report. The gross margin had a tiny gain, not impressive. That could have turned off some or many investors. But that's hard to know before the report I think.](/r/stocks/comments/sy7mvx/dow_futures_drop_more_than_400_points_as_tensions/hxx0pxt/)

[the bubble is bursting in purely speculative names, sure. but for companies that have great cash flow, good growth prospects, and good management teams in place this is a great opportunity to buy.   safer names that come to mind: GOOG (22x Forward P/E), AAPL (16x forward), QCOM (14x forward), AMAT (16.4x), LRCX (17.3x). these will all have double digit revenue growth for the foreseeable future (except maybe apple).   higher P/E names that i'm buying: NVDA (still not cheap at 42x forward), AMD (28x forward), ASML, (33.8x), TSLA (50-60x forward, depending what you assume for earnings this year - street est is low imo)  hell, even FB looks attractive at these levels. their TTM cash from operations is $57B. their market cap is now $561B. They are trading at 9.84x last 12 month's cash flow... that's cheap unless you think growth will decelerate very very quickly (not likely imo - instagram isn't going anywhere).   stay away from the ""shit"" / meme names until things get better...

As far as individual tickers go: 

WISH - Has had some DP buying as the price slid. Could see a bounce 

CRWD - Sitting right at support and if it holds this area, will be massive since this will mean a successful backtest of prior break out zone 

TSLA - Bounce straight back to the 665 lvl yesterday, currently sitting at 670 in PM. 665 holds and we get to see 677 otherwise it‚Äôs the same old story of being down to the 650‚Äôs. Past 674 it has potential of a gap fill

MRNA - Ideal scenario MRNA retests and holds above 399.5. After that you got 406.3 - 420.6 - 434 - 445 - 459. 406 to 420 has a ton of noise so need to be nimble within this range

ZM - Held the very important 343-346 lvl so far. Even with market weakness like we saw yesterday, sellers couldn‚Äôt break through this support. It is prime for a bounce. On the upside we got 353 - 363 - 372",positive

"The market shoots TSLA to the moon over the Hertz deal. But realistically, it doesnt change much. Tesla would have sold these cars anyway and at a higher margin (40k per car is kind of on the cheap side for a Tesla). The positive effect is, that more customers will get exposure to Teslas, which in turn sells more Teslas, kind of like the ""only test drive a tesla if you are sure you can buy one"" effect. But larger, as this exposes customers to Teslas that do not consider a test dive of a Tesla. But you got to be a bull to believe this anyway. So while this increases demand for the future to come, it doesnt really change anything since Teslas is not demand constrained.

[So stockholders were unsettled by the earnings but the loss is almost 100% attributable to the current chip shortage. Player hardware sales are actually higher than it was this same time in 2019. The main reason for the miss in adds was due to TV supply shortages and increases.   https://www.amazon.com.br/SMART-AOC-ROKU-43S5195-78G/dp/B08487HB7G/ref=zg_bs_16243809011_62?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=G68B0R9D9TX4CWVQSQB1  This is a link to a fast selling Roku TV being sold in Brazil, that is currently out of stock.   Platform revenues grew 80% YoY from 2020. Roku took around a $25 million write-down from player losses compared to previous years.   The reason for this is because Roku decided to prioritize their supply of players by paying for more expensive air and expedited shipping to keep players in stock. This raised their costs. They couldn't do this for their TV's because those have longer supply chains and are also partially controlled by 3rd parties.   If you believe that supply chain issues are temporary, then this is really just a one-time loss due to those supply chain issues.   In my view, there is nothing about their core business that raises any fears for me. Roku beat all their other metrics handily - 50% increased ARPU, 600% earnings beat, platform revenues up 80% yoy, their Shopify beta was oversubscribed on day 1, and they are on track to expand to Peru and Chile internationally this year. Their only issue now is active account growth, and that is more a factor of supply chain issues than anything else.  If you simply ignore their entire hardware business and treat it as profit-neutral. Do your DCF analysis using their platform revenues only and Roku is actually fantastically valued as a software company growing at an 80% clip.  Also good to note it is valued at around 16-17x 2021 platform revenues compared to NET which is at 90x revenues, and Roku platform revenues are growing faster than NET.

[It's just conjecture, but I think a lot of apes bought stocks on the margin.  That's basically taking out a loan to buy stocks from their brokers.  When the stocks go up, they make money without having to pay as much up front.  But when they go down, they owe.  The only thing worse is shorting a stock and seeing it explode through the roof.  If you don't buy on the margin, stocks go up, stocks go down, no big deal.  Well, unless the company invested in does an Enron or Lehman Brothers and drops dead.  I love WSB, but I rarely take its advice.  The only time I did was on GME and only then to screw hedge funds.

[The poison pill stops Musk.  I suppose the Board decided that Musk is too crazy, unpredictabvle and intrusive to allow to be their boss or buy them out. Plus , Musk's idea that fake news, hate speech, riot inciting and fascist or extremist BS is ""free speech"" is wrong, and they are right.  Free speech rights do not cover any of the above, and that is why Russian trolls, trump and far rightwing Qanon types like Taylor Greene get kicked off social media, because they aren't just wrong, they are the equivalent of disinformation malware. Musk is known to BS online too, he likes to attack and play with peoples heads.  he is not a serious CEO, and TSLA stock is 300% overvalued.  If Musk did pay 50 billion he would also have to liquidate so much TSLA that the price would end up cut in half, so in a sensae he'd end up paying 2-3 times as much.](/r/stocks/comments/u4ee21/twitter_counters_a_musk_takeover_with_a_plan_to/i4y085n/)

"It really depends on location too.  100k a year is fundamentally minimum wage in VHCOLAs.

My advice is to keep investing and don‚Äôt hold cash as much as possible (I hold a bit has efund and for tax payments as we pay 4 times a year due to the business).

Our wealth hasn‚Äôt been really spent on any depreciating assets except for our car.  Now more than half of our NW is in real estate with most of the rest in mostly ETFs and a couple of stocks (still have a large chunk in TSLA that I‚Äôm riding until we start seeing more major legacy automakers consolidate/fold).

I‚Äôve lived through several financial crises and the sky always falls for a period and comes back after that.  The goal is to be ready for the sky falling and capitalize.  

This past year we bought a house in Phuket, Thailand as we were planning to FIRE to Thailand.  Got it for less than 1/2 the price it would have been just a couple of years ago due to COVID destroying the tourism economy.

[That‚Äôs a fair comment. When I‚Äôm first trying to determine whether I should spend the time researching a company the first think I look at is forward P/E, analyst estimates for revenue and earnings, and their income statements. If the stocks have a high valuation relative to their growth then that‚Äôs easy I spent 30 seconds and I can easily eliminate them and find a better company. If they are at a good valuation then I can spend the time researching them.   I do think that SBUX is a better growth at a reasonable price stock, they have better growth, lower valuation then PEP and they usually trade at a premium to the market. I know that SBUX does have a lot of short term problems that I haven‚Äôt looked into: Coffee prices have rose significantly, unionization, whatever is happening with their CEO that Schultz came back as interim CEO. SBUX has more growth expected than a lot of value stocks so it may not be bad, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs cheap but it may not be bad. The main ones I want to avoid are PEP at 25 P/E and 4% Rev growth, or MCD 25 P/E and 3% rev growth. SBUX at 23 P/E and 10% rev growth may worth moving onto the next step of research if the concerns aren‚Äôt major.](/r/stocks/comments/uh5z7q/pepsi_or_starbucks_as_an_addition_to_the_portfolio/i75l4s3/)

"Yea you must be disciplined and take your time to properly learn the Greek ratios and how they correlate with price movements and also instead of trying to trade everything take a few stocks and I would say ones you like and actually believe in and focus on them, watch their daily movement their charts their patterns and how they react to volume movements and other market and exterior conditions. That way you can develop a system that works for you and focus on relevant data instead of overloading with a little bit of everything. Also again it is vital you understand what your doing and what your goal is for any trade in particular, you must have a exit strategy both for it it doesn‚Äôt pan out and for if it does like you should not let a trade go below 12-16% negative unless it‚Äôs a rare scenario and you have charted out the recovery or there is some crazy outside factor like a TSLA or a GME, and you also must have enter strategy and this comes with, like anything else, time and learning and unfortunately we learn more from our failures and mistakes then we do from our successes. If you take a positive note you have lost not a lot of $$ at all I have lost thousands trading and I know colleagues and friends who have lost tens of thousands trading, but if you learn your craft like anything and realize what your doing wrong and keep at it then it‚Äôs more of a learning curve then a failure and sometimes it‚Äôs better to suffer in the short term to prosper in the long term.

On confirmation of a breakout, I enter, usually buying the closets ITM call or put. I take profit at 10-15%.  No stop losses initially. Only when I hit my profit target do I set a stop loss under my target, in case it runs further.  I think I need to get better at waiting for a better exit.

Overall I‚Äôm still bearish on tsla due to monthly long bearish market structure. It would have to get above certain levels and change ms on the daily before I start turning bullish again. However this jump had a high probability of bouncing which is why I was confident in giving an example. The reason the majority lose and think TA is bullshut is cause they all use the same indicators that are not really any good. Therefore it‚Äôs not a coin flip if you know what you‚Äôre doing.

"I wasn't a WSB regular but was subscribed to it for a few years and just browsed and sometimes commented for entertainment really. I noticed it started getting bad with TSLA and a few other fad stocks around that time. 

Like they go all in on a few stocks at the same time, then when those stocks decline (though TSLA continued to do well), the consensus will start shifting against those stocks and for some new fad stocks. Same happened with GME, before the spike in late January, most didn't really take it seriously and few would know who DFV was. By February, the focus had shifted to GME and any other stock they could find with the least bit similar situation that could spike, AMC was one of those. 

After a few months, sub consensus started shifting against GME and AMC, but more like a split or a slight majority, varied by thread and what mods were allowing, which changed constantly. They never really got beyond that unfortunately. 

And last night, the GME fanatics started spamming due to the AH jump from $130 to $170. Either some thinking it was MOASS, others knowing it was likely something else and maybe temporary but would be useful for luring new people in (""buy GME asap before it's too late as it's skyrocketing again just like last January!"").

The last time I bought calls were more CRSR calls in July to *average down* when it dipped.. and now it‚Äôs even lower.. just don‚Äôt do options. That‚Äôs the reason why I‚Äôm down as much as I am.

[Growth tech wasn't even that expensive and people are probably about to find this out. Yeah, they looked expensive relative to companies with low signal digit annual growth, but a lot of them traded at 20-30 sales which isn't outrageous given the growth and margins a lot of them have. For example, FB traded at a PS in the low 20s for years and FB until this year was a great investment. People (including me btw) made the same crappy argument about TSLA, but had they understood how much growth and margin potential TSLA had it would have been a no brainer.  We now have quality growth stocks like SHOP trading with a PS in the teens and a 30+% YoY growth rate. That's insanely cheap. You could argue a lot of quality growth stocks are more mispriced now than a year ago, just now it's in the other direction.  That said, it depends a lot on where interest rates end up and if there is a recession. The risk here is that a lot of unprofitable growth stocks rely on debt and would probably struggle in a higher rate, lower growth environment. But still, if you're not buying junk and buying growth stocks that can survive a recession (SHOP, SQ, ABNB, UBER, etc) you should be fine if you're investing for the long-term.](/r/stocks/comments/tem9k1/dont_kick_yourself_later_for_making_impulsive/i0sznas/)

[Disclaimer: I'm long on PEI. I'm not a financial advisor and this isn't investment advice. The market risks of any stock mean you can lose a substantive portion (or all!) of your investment. These are just my casual musings and you accept the risks of acting or not acting on this post. All data as according to Fintel.  I've been writing about PREIT **(NYSE:PEI)**, the small-cap regional commercial real estate investment trust that could, over the past few days. The nearly-distressed company reported blowout Q4 earnings this week, placing some support under its stock price and threatening a short squeeze. Take a look at the pinned and recent posts on my profile for my prior posts.  **An update on yesterday's price action:** I was watching the stock closely as the price slid in pre-market trading and witnessed trend reversal just a bit after 10 am. The stock began a new trading pattern, setting new supports down and breaking resistances as it began to climb. I'll be tuned in closely to see if the short squeeze develops, given short % of float at 23%. While the short ratio remains incredibly high, it ticked down on Wednesday as the stock rose, indicating shorts are trying to exit their positions. But given the low daily trading volumes on PEI, I'm not sure they'll be able to.  I'm not the only one watching PEI closely. For example, take a look at the recently published **Seeking Alpha article:** **'PREIT Q4 FFO Increases, Helped by Higher Rents and Occupancy Rates'**.  **And last but not least, more good news:** PREIT found a buyer for the Exton Square mall. This property was relatively unproductive, generating less than $300 in sales/sq ft, which is roughly in line with national averages but less than half of PREIT's average. CEO Joseph Coradino said the sale is expected to close within 90 days and the company will use the funds to pay off debt. These are exactly the sort of transactions I want to see as an investor: the divestment of relatively under-productive assets to shore up financials, so the company's star properties can really shine.  PREIT reported it was cash-flow positive at the end of 2021, with a very nice net cash position of **$69 million**. In comparison, the company held $5.9 million at the end of the prior year. The increase, according to CFO Mario Ventresca, was due to improved results and diligent collections of outstanding accounts.  I remain long on all my shares!  Ps. ty to the mods for letting me post my content here. It's been tough to get these posts up. I know the stock subs on reddit get flooded with a lot of misinfo and spam so let me state unequivocally: I'm not being compensated in any way to do this. I'm in no way associated with PREIT or any other involved party. This entire research project stems out of my own interest in the retail sector, which I've been actively following (first professionally and now as an investor) for a bit over a decade now.

[They are direction agnostic they hold both long/short options, they make money on the spread. MM with a long call imbalance will short the shit out of something as that delta climbs, and they don't need to locate shares while they do it.    charm is the delta decay with respect to time, it can accelerate into expiration **especially** when there is a market holiday (e.g. Mon.). As delta decays MM who are short otm calls/long otm puts dump the extra delta on their hedges. A large enough OI on a low float stock can create a feedback loop...  The IV also halfed... across the board. Vanna won't save you either.   Next time you want to pump something, try the 2 weeks after monthly OPEX; vanna and charm won't work against you.  Since I have you attention, also know that MM option dealers hedge an option trade **before**, your option trade hits the tape. From then, they are constantly rebalancing their delta. as often as every 15min. (watch the candles at the 15min. mark). True there might be some last min. hedging EOD into OPEX, but not nearly what you claim in your post.

"[Excellent summary of MSFT.   My only counter argument is that most of what you listed is well established. MSFT has not a lot of room to grow as far as windows, office, &amp; Xbox.  I‚Äôm not familiar with the gaming subs, but if you have to have it to use your Xbox, it‚Äôs a great recurring revenue stream, but I question the opportunity for growth.   As far as Azure, I think there is a significant opportunity there. I know every company I‚Äôve ever worked for needs to switch to Azure, and none have yet. I suspect that‚Äôs true for many companies. Now as to the growth potential on that front, I would even know how to begin to quantify that.   As far as GOOGL, I think they have to ability to monetize a lot more than they do currently. They have us by the balls, and they ratchet the price WAY up before people begin to try to find an alternative. They also have a quantum computer that will be coming around soon. We won‚Äôt all have one, but companies will be buying time on it for a pretty penny. They are top 5 in mobile devices, and will be top 3 before long.

"Thanks for your comment....I believe TSLA due to its vertically integrated supply chain and battery technology will be able to make the most money from EV's.  I think their margin's are like 30% per car while other automakers struggle to break even on EV's.  They will be like Apple in that they make the most money from EV's like Apple makes the most money from smartphones compared to other smart phone manufacturers.  Apple is considered a premium product and a status symbol so they can charge more.  TSLA will be like that except for EV's.  I think they will continue to grow in the forseeable future.

The Bond CEF's I own do have durations between 5-7 years and have gotten hit pretty bad this year.  Most are down around 15-25%.  I think they may be trying to bottom here however.  I am ok with holding them because they have yields that are equal to or greater than inflation and I'm reinvesting all the dividends.",positive

"When you say maximum realistically possible, that means you are admitting that there are some scenarios which are unlikely because those scenarios are unrealistic, but still possible. Keep that in mind. Going forward from here -

It's actually quite easy - but you have to answer this question -

&gt;""has several percent chance to happen in a lifetime"", but not ""as likely as getting killed by a car""

What percentage are we talking about. Once you know that, then you just plot the stocks (and similar universe of stock's movement) for a given time period and make a distribution plot. The distribution can be filtered by removing earnings date data and other similar filters that you would like to exclude. 

After that since you already know how much % you are saying is ""Realistic"", you can simply check the histogram and check what ranges comprise of that percentage of times that you are looking for.

It couldn't get any simpler than that.

\--------- HOWEVER-----------

That's historical data. No guarantee of future results. And stock market distributions have a fat tail statistically.

You need to take into account of the unrealistic but still possible scenarios. Elon Musk dies of a heart attack and TSLA drops 30% kind of things.

"No worries. We all here to learn. I am glad that you are taking this in your stride and showing your eagerness to learn. Let me try and poke a few holes in your rationale to help you understand where I'm coming from. Hopefully it'll help. 

When you say you ""believe in the power of EV"", do you know what goes behind a good EV? What are customers looking at? (FYI: EVs not within my circle of competence, but I can share my limited knowledge)

Before you buy an EV (or any car for that matter), I, as a customer will look at a few things: mileage, charging infrastructure, price, customer reviews, and how this EV is different from its competitors (eg: TSLA, if looking at it from a consumer perspective). If you want to look at the EV industry in general, then I'll ask ""why not NVVE? They're doing EVs but for buses, and their business model is that they charge the EV buses during periods of Low demand and then discharge back into the power grid during periods of high demand to gain some profit. They don't even own the buses, so they are extremely asset light"". So in summary, you can't just ""believe in the power of EV"" and expect it to do well. 

""AQB seems to have a vision... innovative technology for farming seafood""
What's their pricing power in the seafood market though? Which part of the value chain do they play? Do customers REALLY like their seafood? I mean I don't have to eat seafood every day. So many other protein sources out there. ALL companies who wish to hype up their investors will say they have a plan - paint a rosy picture of what they can do for the world yada yada. But what is their action plan? How will they do it? Does it sound feasible to you?

It's definitely a lot to digest, seeing how you're gonna receive multiple comments at one go. I recommend watching YouTube videos to learn (I recommend Brian feroldi, chicken genius Singapore, invest with jang). Otherwise, you can also read books (I think this takes really long in my opinion) or attend a good investing course (this was what I did to expedite my learning).",positive

There is some lag in institutional data, but it appears that 62.13% of Tesla's shares are likely immune to TV narratives (insiders won't sell, institutions are the ones trying to move the markets on TV).

[You mean like Amazon or Google or something? Who cares how many shares you get. That's totally meaningless. The stock price itself is also meaningless. What actually matters is the percentage gain or loss you make on the stock. And in regards to price, what matters is the companies market cap.  But if you make 10 percent holding a single share of Amazon, or make 10 percent holding 10 shares of Facebook, who gives an F? 10 percent is 10 percent is 10 percent.  The only thing that matters with a stock price being really low or really high, is that theoretically it seems way easier for SOFI's stock to double than say AMZN. SOFI going to $35 seems easier than Amazon going to $6,500.  One thing that sort of sucks about giant behemoth corporations like Amazon or Apple, is that they've already grown so much and dominated so much, that they become victims of their own success.](/r/stocks/comments/q1gk89/protip_when_good_stocks_are_on_sale_dont_buy/hfjf1xe/)

"[&gt;I personally am very bullish on TSLA and believe that it has a 90% chance of becoming the next biggest company in the world by 2030.  It is already valued higher than most of the other car companies combined.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;From what I see, no company can produce EVs as cheaply, as high quality and as many as Tesla (not even Chinese EVs).  Look at the recent reliability data. Tesla is dead last, even behind Dacia. Also other car manufacturers are slow to adapt but then fast. Tesla does not have the ability to produce 10m cars yearly. Toyota and VW do.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;They have the trifecta of manufacturing and EVs are still in the early adoption phase. Legacy auto makers have stagnant evaluations for the last decade.  Sure, but they pumped billions more into research than Tesla did, and current offerings from Hyundai, Kia and Porsche are considered excellent already. Adoption phase does not matter, as it is already valued as though it would surpass the others.  &gt;Tesla is also the current leader in FSD technology,  Where do you have the data? Musk promised since 2015 that it is basically solved and it will be here next year. Mercedes is the first Level 3 car with included liabilities and Venmo and Cruise are already driving in selected cities without a driver. How is FSD the leading technology?.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;although it has a long way to go, growth in AI is exponential and we will get there eventually within a reasonable time frame.  Yeah no. Even if everything goes smoothly, Level 5 autonomy everywhere will take at least a decade.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Tesla is going to be more of a robotaxi company than a car company. The economic gain of robotaxis is going to be insane, cars sit idle 95% of the time any decent economist will tell you that is money being lit on fire. If they can reduce that to just 70% idle, it will result in at least a trillion saved by not requiring a driver, increased speed of traffic, reduced accidents, and most importantly (in US and Canada) not being financially burdened by owning a car just to name a few.  I think you should do your calculation how much it actually saves (it is not a lot) - and how much it costs to maintain a vehicle that is driving most of the day. The driver of taxi companies gets around 30% of the fare. Include the R&amp;D costs of robotaxis and I can't see, how margins will be better than taxi companies (they have terrible margins).  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;It is more correct to say a Tesla revolution than an EV revolution.  How? It does not change how most people use their car. Au contraire, with increased competition, Tesla will either be forced to produce a cheap car -  so that they can really produce the amount of cars they are valued for - and thus decreasing margin, or they can have high margins with selling not a lot of cars. Either way, the multiple will suffer.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;I did my research on TSLA back in mid 2021 and I strongly believe that today, in terms of information available and TSLA financials, is the best time to invest because there is very little uncertainty. If your bearish on Tesla I want to know why and if I'm missing anything in my arguments.  If Tesla is your best idea, please search again. Also: Please look at the materials that go into a Tesla. Most of them more than doubled the last year -  decreasing margins further.](/r/stocks/comments/tny5je/those_who_are_bearish_on_tsla_what_are_your_main/i24551j/)

"Key Trendline Could Send EV Giant Tesla Back Up the Charts  
By: Schaeffer's Investment Research | December 15, 2021  
  
‚Ä¢ Tesla stock is trading near a trendline that's acted as a springboard in the past  
  
‚Ä¢ Tesla could benefit from a shift in the options pits  
  
Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) notched a record high of $1,243.49 around the time the company joined the trillion-dollar club, but has pulled back in recent weeks. In fact, since that peak, the equity has taken a nearly 25% haircut. Despite its shaky performance on the charts of late, investors shouldn't swear off the stock just yet, as it has dipped to a key trendline with historically bullish implications.  
  
Specifically, TSLA has come within one standard deviation of its 80-day moving average after of trading above the trendline since July. According to data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, at least four similar signals have occurred in the past three years. The equity enjoyed a positive return one month later in half of those instances, averaging a 12% gain. From the stock's current perch of $935, a similar move would put Tesla stock back over the $1,000 mark. Even better, the stock's 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 32 sits just on the cusp of ""oversold"" territory. This indicator typically predates a short-term bounce.  
  
\[Suppressed Image\]  
  
Put buying is still all the rage, leaving ample room for a shift in sentiment amongst options traders, that could boost the shares higher. Data from the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX) shows the security with a 10-day put/call volume ratio of 1.20, which ranks higher than all other readings in its annual range, meaning puts are being bought at their fastest rate in 12 months.  
  
Tesla stock has tended to exceed options traders volatility expectations during the past year. This is per TSLA's Schaeffer's Volatility Scorecard (SVS), which ranks at a high 80 out of 100.",positive

"[I personally own Google. I think they have a good long term future.  However, remember that companies come and go. Ideas change, human behavior changes, innovation happens and the world can look very different very fast. Think Sears, GE, IBM, Exxon, AT&amp;T, Intel, Cisco, GM, NTT, HP, etc. in their heyday no one ever thought that they would give up their leadership position as the top companies by market cap. However, companies come and go, boom and bust, new market leaders emerge when new generations step in. No investment is ever certain and it‚Äôs never guaranteed that a market leader today will be a market leader in 10-20 years. That‚Äôs why people always recommend the S&amp;P500 to capture companies that eventually will rise to the top.  It‚Äôs possible that people will use the internet in completely different ways than we can currently imagine and conceive in today‚Äôs world. Who knows, we may get to a point where people don‚Äôt even type on a phone or a keyboard to search information. We may get to a point where people don‚Äôt use 2d, flat surface monitors or phones in the future. Search engines could look completely different in the future. Will Google spearhead a change?

[Actually, we dont know, in 5-10 years maybe we ""know better"" and dont use Google andinstead to choose another one, like duckduckgo or what ever. Reasons:  1. Google is ""hiding"" 99% of internet 2. Bing is actually growing, it¬¥s default in every Windows and if they implement it better, perhaps some things will change. Bing is not better, but it¬¥s worth the mention 3. Best engineers are not only working for big companies as Google, Facebook and so on anymore. I¬¥,m not the best engineer, but I will never work for Google, Apple or anything. I was offered job at Amazon but denied and my brother was a senior at Google, but quit because it wasnt the same as it was 7 to 10 years ago.  4. As mentioned above, Google is a really big company, that means it¬¥s harder for them to be dynamic like they were 10 years ago. In 90s, we thought IBM was never going to fall, but they were brink of collapse.

NYSE:FSD DATE : Mon Feb 21 00:20:50 2022 SUBREDDIT : stocks



[It‚Äôs not priced that way (ie 75% of cars).   It‚Äôs priced just as Apple was since Apple had superior profitability. Apple was valued at many multiples of all the other phone makers (Nokia, Samsung) just like Tesla is to the other car makers. Cars are just a higher TAM market so Tesla has a much larger growth potential than even Apple did (at least in phones).  Some math - total car market is 100M cars sold per year. If Tesla sells 20% of those (their stated target of 20M cars per year by 2030 and similar to Apple‚Äôs market share of phones) then they will have revenues of at least $30k x 20M = $600B. With a gross margin of 30% (their current automotive gross margin; industry leading) it will have $180B in operating income. At a 30x P/E multiple that is $5.4T market cap (if you discount this back to today with 20% then Tesla should be worth $1T today).   This is probably an underestimation since it ignores their insurance, charging, service, solar, battery, FSD, HVAC, and Teslabot business lines, but there‚Äôs no guarantee that they‚Äôll be as successful in all of those businesses. No one knows the future, but it is very easy to get todays valuation without absurd assumptions like selling 75% of all cars. No one believes that.](/r/stocks/comments/sx6klf/the_stock_is_not_the_company_and_the_company_is/hxtrc9t/)

I also tend to avoid hot/trendy companies/sectors ... boring companies are better.   my only technical analysis is looking to see that the stock's price doesn't have a years long downward trend.

When I originally posted this play (Jun 9), I said:

&gt;I don't expect her to fall so low, but it's a small gamble.  
This is a quick day trade, so I'll update under this comment.

She touched $656.59 yesterday.  
Of course, I still think she'll fall lower than that because this bear market still has at least--at least--another significant leg down. Honestly, I think she has even more than that, but that drop will bring a good rally, and if biotech keeps holding, China confirms their stocks have already printed their bottom, and data keeps suggesting inflation has peaked, then I expect we'll chop around for a while instead of searching for the bottom.

Anyway, at that time, I didn't expect she would get there that fast.

NASDAQ:MSFT / 11

[Started around 29 ish still in my 30s. I stuck to mostly tech stocks as that is what I knew and understood got burned by Solar stocks when they sector was red hot l, made some Money but when I went long the sector tanked and like a noob I held for a few months but after seeing constant loss of what little I had left I sold and took what I would call serious losses back than. Learned to look at ERs and do some basic research , looked a market trends and see what company was making the right moves. Things they aren‚Äôt always highlighted on a balance sheet. my picks were tech and better yet what I knew and had used - MSFT NVDA AMD AAPL CRM SQ even after recent massive downturn have kept me very much in the green.   I have TSLA a good amount  of it I don‚Äôt include it usually as I think the growth there just throws my portfolio out of whack.. like 1500% or something . Tesla taught me to be a patient investor and have faith in the company and leadership regardless  of short term fluctuations or all the chaos that it has created since IPO.   In the past 2 years I have started to invest in Div growth stocks and some other Div stable Stocks like O, Abbvie KO Pfizer WM V.  I have realized I am over exposed to tech and even though besides SQ everything has held up decently it‚Äôs still painful to see a 15-20% drop on gains.  Started with $3500 and  invested over time not regularly just when I could afford to. Got married, had kids, bought our dream home.. my investments have given me A sense of financial calm and stability that helped a lot in other aspects of life like relationships, higher education and career growth.

NASDAQ:UK / 9

[Most US stocks are overpriced by historical metrics, and it does make this environment very difficult for investing. Personally, I think anything bought at any price in 2021 is risky for the medium-term.  Which is why I'm mainly going international right now: Australia and Brazil are my current favorites.

"[So full of misinformation.  OL Cognition data isn't 100% definitive of efficacy clinically at this stage but that's a strawnan argument.  I'm not arguing there is no value in P3. The point is that the data is very promising - and it is. Alzheimer's patients don't as a group have a placebo effect in cogs scoring at 12 months it simply doesn't happen and there have been loads of trials to show. This is why the FDA is so excited and granted SPAs.  1. Baseline shift is likely due to covid crisis and was shown between 6 and 9 months. Near zero shift afterwards. As I have explained previously, the FDA has seen all the raw data of who dropped and why and had no concern - has granting SPAs for P3.  2. No evidence any short got into any trial. Some assholes went and lied on initial question and made a big deal when not initially kicked out. Again, a fabricated issue and the FDA was happy with the data and streamlined P3s for SAVA because of it. 3. Company needs to limit disclosure now because shorts will take any bit of information and twist it into FUD. They are doing what is typical for pharma companies once in P3 and letting the final trials complete. Besides, once again, every little bit of data you are making a complaint about pretending it should all be given in the normal course (it wouldn't)... guess who has it? That's right!!! The FDA!!! Oh and what did the FDA do with all that data you are suggesting hides some mysterious problem? They granted two SPAs to STREAMLINE P3 for SAVA because they like me are so excited about it!  Oh and there is one other party than the FDA that can see much of this data and what did they do? SAVA insiders who held even after a 20x run up. They. Sold. Nothing.  Compare the lack of insider selling at SAVA with that other Alzheimer's company they came out with a miss a couple months back. Those folks new what was coming and sold in mass.  The FDA excitement with granting SPAs, the lack of insider selling, the never before seen with or without one year cognition improvements... this all points to one result.  Again, you made some money misleading folks, but you would do well to get out before the CP expires.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sagf7l/cassava_sava_is_heading_for_the_moon_after_fda/hturypj/)

\-panic selling at the bottom

\-buying high IV calls only to see it drop further

\-buying high IV puts only to see it climb. 

So I didn't do any of those things, instead made some small stock buys at what I thought was the bottom (but wasn't) and sold a few covered calls at what I thought was the top (but wasn't).

[Yeah i dont think i unfortunately came into the stock market and non stock market with realistic expectations. I had friends who pre pandemic invested and they got some $$$$ when it hit recovery mode. And then not having any information i started reading all these subs on reddit and realizing now and looking back now i see they ALL gave me beyond unrealistic expectations (not even w.s.b) just the normal subs. I was looking for the casino not the 20+ year investment   Another thing (mostly non stock) that burnt me is my tolerance. I got nervous on dips on the way up too much and also timed the market terribly way too many times.   For non stocks looking back i had invested in the 2nd biggest one initially when it was at $900 warched it go to 1200 (got excited) saw it dip to $700 (got scared af) and sold at $1000. Later reinvested at the top thinking it was going to continue its run and from there it was all down hill. I kept getting tripped up with holding ""knowing itll recover"" and selling ""knowing its gonna dip"" i learned through that though a ton about charting and technicals which will help me in the future for options for sure. But i learned now that im investing way way more that seeing my profile take a 25% hit in 1 one is not fun for me. Not one bit.

[Having 9k as a 22 year old is a great head start.  Just show him historical returns and explain compounding interest. I would point out to him that based on historical returns if he were to take his 9k and:  1: Put it in a broad-based index fund (like VOO).  2: Turn on DRIP (to reinvest the dividends).  3: WALK AWAY AND NEVER TOUCH IT  In ten years he should have anywhere from 16k-22k. From doing nothing.  If he continues not touching it for another ten years after that on the low end he will have 31k or the high end 52k, but more probably somewhere in between around the 37k-43k zone.  So essentially what he's done if ALL he does is take this 9k and invest it in VOO when he's 22, and leave it alone til he's 44, is add 2k/year to what he earns. And it's really that easy.  An good milestone for long-term financial health is having ~100k free and clear (i.e. no debt against it) invested (including your 401k) by the time you're 30. You're not fucked if you can't accomplish it, and it's not a guarantee of success, but if you CAN do it, it means a lot of your financial goals for the rest of your life are going to be downhill battles.  By investing this 9k now in a broad-based index fund NOW at 22 he's basically already 20% of the way to that goal. If he can somehow invest 12,500 now instead of 9,000 he's 30% of the way to that goal. If he can invest 12,500 today at 22 and CONTINUE to invest $1,000 every year and increase that amount by $50 each year, he is halfway to that goal.  I would show him this in excel and point to the dollar symbol at the end of each ""scenario"" and say ""THAT is YOU in 10 years (or however many) if you do this.""](/r/stocks/comments/r9xqr1/advice_on_how_to_invest_14k_for_someone_young/hnhhbtd/)

"I own a lot of PLTR as well, though it only makes up 1.5-2% of my overall portfolio.

Most of Reddit scoffs at Palantir (like they did and still do to some extent with Tesla), but I have pretty high conviction in Palantir's long term prosects to become as important to private enterprise and governments as Microsoft or Amazon AWS.

I think my cost basis is now about 21, after I bottom fed on PLTR by adding a bunch of shares in the 10-12 range.  Down 33% overall today, but I'm used to the volatility after 10+ years of being a TSLA shareholder",positive

[September and October are historically rough for the market and then November December and January are usually very good. If you‚Äôre hesitant maybe wait until last day of October before you start buying. I find that news and fundamentals and analysis is all noise compared to just watching price action. Anything that‚Äôs got significantly more green days than red over the last month and is putting up around 2-3% on up days and only down around 1-2% on up days is on a solid up trend.  Stay away from things that are making wild swings or if they‚Äôre getting ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù trying to get a good deal you‚Äôll just get burned most likely.  Watch which sectors are currently out performing and then pick the best performers there to buy into. For example energy has been on a roll for the last month, banks did well for a while until recently and have slowed with earnings this week causing last minute hesitancy, real estate outperformed today. Auto manufactures are on a roll for a while too and historically perform well in this quarter.  BAC was great for a bank stock Apa top tier for energy Tsla F and GM have all been doing well.  All these have been good while the market overall has been correcting.  If you only hold stocks that have strong upward momentum and cut out ones that are weak then you‚Äôll make consistent gains over time](/r/stocks/comments/q6waq1/navigating_the_endless_stream_of_news_and/hget9lw/)

1) Should I continue holding my existing 127 shares of tsla at least until say a Price Target of $1400 or Q4 earnings (whichever comes first) and then sell part (or all of these 127 shares)? Then buy back after we drop to $1000 or below (by March)?

2) When (how soon) and in what manner, would you invest another $100k in Tesla right now if you had 100k and wanted to make sure you got the most number of shares at the best price possible?

Something tells me I should wait for a Red day where we drop say 9% before accumulating shares).  And Dollar Cost average on the way down?

"[I‚Äôve been bag-holding AAPL for over 10 years. There have been quarters with disappointing iPhone sales before (the iPhone 6s year, for example), but sooner or later Apple always rebounds because it tends to be quick at identifying issues and often turns them into strengths.   The growth of iPhone sales has decreased for a while now, everyone knows smartphones are a mature product now and people tend to use them longer. That‚Äôs why Apple created the $1000 phone category in the first place. They‚Äôve also diversified a lot, with services still growing strong, and the Mac being more appealing than ever due to the switch to Apple silicon. Apple also has fantastic production efficiency, does a lot in-house, has special privileges with its manufacturers (for example, Foxconn making sure that Apple products are assembled on time even when everything else is on hold), and is actively working on reducing its reliance on China for manufacturing. The fact that they plan a huge stock buyback is also a good sign of its health, in my opinion.  Yes, a couple of bad quarters could be bad for the company. And yes, it‚Äôs still very reliant on iPhone sales. Generally, I expect their growth to slow in the future, possibly turning into a value stock over the next 5‚Äì10 years. But I don‚Äôt think Apple has any more risks than Google, and the argument ‚Äúit‚Äôs not the same price it was in 2019‚Äù doesn‚Äôt really convince me.  If you want to play some short-term bets against Apple be my guest, but I‚Äôm sleeping very well with my shares (admittedly, I‚Äôve sold a lot this year and only have 700 left).](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uzrgaa/anyone_else_think_aapl_still_has_some_downside/iacccms/)

[I know a lot of investors are excited about the AAPL car and have often bid up AAPL stock price whenever there's headlines like this. But I honestly think that at the end of the day the Apple car project will be nothing but a giant waste of money that will probably never return any kind of profit. I mean, consider this:  * There's a lot of new EV companies out there, but only 1 of them has ever achieved consistent profitability, Tesla, and it took them well over 10+ years to do that.   * Apple is jumping into the EV market very late. They don't even have a single car factory, they haven't even announced a car model that they'll bring to the market in the distant future. The competition meanwhile that previously ignored EV's is collectively throwing in tens of billions of dollars into EV/battery research each year. Point being by the time Apple is finally ready to bring an EV to market there will be a ton more competition in the space then there is today.  * Apple's brand is realistically not going to help them much at selling cars. Tesla's brand is already basically the Apple of the car space, in that they get a ton of free advertising in social media, and people see them as the #1 premium EV automaker. If the average person wants the best EV they'll probably look at Tesla, just as if someone wants the best smartphone they'll probably look at Apple because of their reputation in that space. This point goes back to the 2nd point somewhat, in that Apple's brand would have been a lot more helpful at selling cars if they hadn't given Tesla such a huge head start now that they're selling several hundred thousand cars a quarter.  About the only way I can see the Apple car division ever returning a profit for investors in a reasonable time period is if Apple can solve level 5 self driving multiple years before anyone else. But given all the competition in that space, and all the money being thrown at that problem, plus all the secrecy about their progress, I think it's impossible to really say who can solve level 5 self driving, or when they'll solve it.](/r/stocks/comments/ukq1d0/apple_hires_31year_ford_veteran_to_ramp_up/i7qv1ww/)

NASDAQ:MSFT / 47

[On a serious note, I'm so confused on what I should do. I'm very anxious and it's stressing me out so much that my portfolio is down 53% (35k). I'm in SOFI, DKNG, NIO, and ETH. Down 60% on DKNG and 70% on NIO.   I'm young, but it really feels like I just wasted my past 2 years working (which is all the work experience I have considering I graduated).   Should I just take my losses even though it's bear market? I swear every time I tell myself that it'll eventually go back up, it gets worse and worse. Now we're pretty much in a recession.  Is it better to take my losses and reinvest that money into safer stocks like GOOGL, AAPL, MSFT? Or is there a safer/better option anywhere else? I haven't been investing, I've been gambling because I was introduced to stocks during COVID, naive of the fact that it was a bubble. Didn't do DD (never learned ...

[They are merging with an existing privately held electric car company.  Basically, NAKD has $270mil in cash in the bank right now and no real way to make it ""work"".  Cenntro is an electric vehicle manufacturer that could use an injection of cash.  Essentially NAKD is investing its working capital in Cenntro in exchange for partial ownership of the company.    One thing to keep in mind when evaluating Cenntro is that they specialize in commercial vehicles.  More specifically, they are targeting the ""last mile"" delivery vehicle space (think UPS/FedEx/Amazon delivery trucks).  They are primarily trying to complete in EU due to their vehicles' low top-speed and short max-distance.  It's hard to sell a 60mph/120mile delivery vehicle in the U.S. in any sizable volume.    Right now Cenntro is in its infancy.  It remains to be seen how their efforts to expand are going to go.  They themselves aren't projecting significant revenue until 2023, which makes it a long-term play at best.  They are a vehicle manufacturer, but given that they are targeting the commercial space almost exclusively, their potential market is smaller than other EV startups.    Their projections for 2022 and 2023 looks amazing.  If they hit those projections, there's going to be quite a lot of stock growth.  Not $50/share though...that's nuts.  But again, the EV space is pretty crowded right now, so I'm inclined to feel their 2022 and 2023 projections are beyond rosy and would be shocked if they hit their $2.1b 2023 revenue target.   Also keep in mind that while the stock will still be listed under ""NAKD"", one of the terms of the deal is that NAKD must sell their core business, leaving the EV vehicle business as the only source of revenue moving forward.  That reinforces the ""long term"" feel of the stock.  The end of 2023 is a long way off to find out if the company is going to sink or swim.  Having a $282m total bankroll (NAKD + Cenntro cash-on-hand) will help them survive for quite a while; I'm not nervous about them going bankrupt before in the next few years.  Still, it's hard to think of holding the stock for the next 24+ months.    That being said, I have 2k shares with an average price of $0.82 right now, so I would be jazzed to see this take off in the near term, even if it's a short ride.](/r/pennystocks/comments/qwc8if/nakd_becoming_ev_company/hl2wyl0/)

"I invested in TSLA quite some to ago; bought my first shares in 2014 and continued to accumulate from that point forward.

It was very clear in 2014 that they had built the best EV ever with the right styling and technology.

It was at that point I started doing research on Elon Musk to educate myself about his history. It was clear to me‚Äîbased on his achievements prior to Tesla‚Äîthat he was a visionary. He almost single handedly accelerated humanity‚Äôs transition to online financial transactions.

After reading Tesla‚Äôs mission statement and plan, I saw enough to believe they could achieve what they said they would.

I also thought that was as clear as day when the Model 3 was announced, because all it was, was a smaller scale version of the Model S.

Biden doesn‚Äôt understand Tesla because he either has oil and gas producers filling his pockets, or‚Äîmore likely‚Äîhe is likely experiencing undetectable early onset Alzheimer‚Äôs. Nobody 78 years old should be able to be POTUS. Especially from the boomer generation. It‚Äôs too freakin‚Äô old! But that‚Äôs another topic of discussion.

The path to 10 million was abundantly clear in 2019 when they started building the Shanghai facility, announced Berlin, and there were whispers of another U.S. facility.

You were late to the party because you were focused on the wrong thing; numbers and, moreover, doubt.

"The OCC receives exercise requests up until 5:30PM ET. A long holder (that includes you, if you have long options) can request to exercise their option that was OTM based on the 4:00PM closing price. Some brokers have earlier cutoffs, but it's not 4:00PM. A long holder can choose to do so for any reason, even if their option was never ITM. It's not a good idea to exercise an OTM option, it never is, but if the option gets ITM in the AH session before 5:30, exercising it can be profitable.

The OCC then takes these requests into some sort of a lottery that night, and notifies the brokers of the people holding the options short. Brokers then choose which short holder gets assigned.

You, as the short holder will not know the result of this lottery (whether you're assigned or not) until much later, typically Friday midnight, to Saturday noon. By then, it's too late to exercise your long option. You can end up being long or short shares going into the weekend, and be exposed to a much larger loss by Monday open.

It's always better to close any positions that include short options, if you're not ready to take surprise assignment.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Edit: This conversation was for ticker $SPY. But I understand it is different for $SPX, which expires 4:15. Thanks in advance for any help understanding this devilry.

Expiring SPX options stop trading at 4:00PM, not 4:15. They don't have pin risk, because they're cash settled with no contrary exercise instructions.

Both SPY and SPX options trade until 4:15PM (Except for the expiring SPX options as mentioned above), that's how TDA was able to close your short option after market close.

Check out this thread, Many traders lost thousands on spreads with max loss of a few hundreds because of pin risk when TSLA moved sharply AH on 9/4/2020. Check out the video linked there too, Chris explains it pretty nicely.

"[I have posted it once, but here we go. First steps:  * Tikr: Screen fundamentals and look what the company does. I also look at the FCF and try to compare it to its historic valuation and how other companies are currently trading or have historically traded. * Read the story behind the company on Wikipedia and research management. * 10k business description and company homepage to see what it does. * Look up analysis of the company on Seeking Alpha, Value Investors Club, Twitter ($TICKER in the search) and on google with filetype:pdf to look at institutional research. * SEC Site: Read 10k and 10Q especially on share dilution/option or something that might be a red flag (a lot of related party transaction etc) * Check Dataroma how many superinvestors are holding the company. That gives you an idea how popular the company is. Usually often held companies are closer to fair value than dismissed companies. * Figure out the business Risks. What risks does the company has? How does inflation influence their business model?- * Ask yourself if you know what the market doesn't- * Is the price inferior to the value that you are getting?I also always try to answer these questions:  ## Industry Study  * Is this a good business? What are the key success factors to superior performance in this industry (VAR -&gt; Value Added Research) * Define the market opportunity.

"[I'm not suggesting GOOG is a bad buy, but keep in mind they had an insane jump in revenues and operating margins over the last couple of years thanks to the increased online ad spend from COVID. I have no idea how sustainable last years revenue or margins are, but if I were buying here that's something I'd want to know.  GOOG also has a lot of exposure to small business and small business could struggle in an environment of high inflation, tightening monetary policy and potentially a recession. I have no idea how likely small business ad spend is to drop from economic weakness, but it's a risk to be aware of.  Finally 22 PE is not a bargain. 22 PE is somewhere around the average valuation of what a mega-cap growth stocks might have traded at historically. I feel like we're forgetting that stocks like AAPL used to trade in the teens and GOOG has often traded in the low 20 PEs.  My fear with tech stocks right now is that we're comparing valuations to those of the last few years during a period of time when they've all been extremely elevated. A forward PE of 22 for GOOG is around average historically, which doesn't seem quite as attractive when you consider the fact rates are going higher everyday and GOOG has possibly had an unsustainable run in recent years. It could easily go lower. A high teens PE wouldn't be crazy for GOOG right now given the growth risks and market sentiment right now.

[""I can't think of a scenario where tech will NOT outperform the market.""  Yea So we are currently in a shift from Growth to Value. Look back in time at a MSFT during the dot com bubble of 1999-2000 and a chart of X (US Steel). Notice what MSFT did after the tech bubble collapsed for the next 13 years.. nothing. Now notice what X did during that same time frame.. $10 to $200. This same rotation is already underway. The trashy growth stocks get smashed first, then higher quality, then eventually they come for the leaders. All growth stocks will get crushed and do nothing over the next 5 years while Value stocks rise up and become the new momentum stocks. Its already happening. Materials and Oil stocks have had massive returns. What makes this time WAY worse then the dot com bubble is the concentration of 30% of the QQQ in like 6 stocks. When the leavy breaks (and it will) all that money hiding out in AAPL, Googl, MSFT, etc will move to value in mass. You can go buy growth stocks that are down 80-90%. They probably wont go much lower. Doesn't mean they are going to go up. Why sit in a portfolio of assets that aren't preforming ? I don't typically trade ""the market"" but my expectations are for zero to single digit growth in the indexes for the next 3-4 years. However under the covers, value stocks will continue to crush it.](/r/stocks/comments/u1hvsq/realistically_where_do_you_see_the_stock_market/i4dpwa8/)

KEYWORD : AAPL DATE : Tue Apr 12 03:02:17 2022 SUBREDDIT : stocks



[Leading stocks generally stall / fall because valuations and growth expectations were too high, not because they stopped growing or got smaller.  For example, if you look at the operating margins of tech companies today they're insane. This is the real the reason why tech dominates. It doesn't matter if you're a car company, a phone company or a cloud company, if you have crazy margins and decent growth at scale you'll be at the top of the indexes. For large companies which can't grow revenue as effectively anymore, margins are really all that matters. The question you should be asking isn't whether a company like GOOG will be bigger in a decade, but where their margins are heading. If a company's margins contract by 50% they would need 100% revenue growth to make up for this. And the problem for the mega caps is that they're so large doubling in size isn't easy anymore.  It's just a fact that as companies grow old they tend to become bloated and less efficient. Margins always begin to flatten out, as does growth. But times continue to change and technology continues to evolve... Smaller, more nimble startup companies will continue to hop onto new trends that are at overlooked by the larger companies (EVs, bitcoin, the internet, etc). Most of these startup companies will fail, but a few will stumble onto something revolutionary and experience the rapid growth and high margins associated with this new industry. As time goes on the older mega-cap tech companies will continue to see slower growth and their margins will begin to fall, both from increased competition and from bloat. As margins and growth falls, so do their elevated valuations. Slowly the innovative companies rise to take their place and go on to dominate for a decade or two before also beginning their slow decline. A company like AMZN might always be around, but in a decade or two it might look more like IBM does today -- still relevant, but not like it was in the past.  In my opinion FB is quite likely to be a smaller company in a decade's time. AAPL potentially could be too. I think there is still a lot of growth left in cloud names (MSFT &amp; AMZN) and I don't see Google slowing anytime soon, but it would be a mistake to believe big tech companies will grow and continue to expand margins forever. Both MSFT and AMZN are huge companies and trade at significant premiums to the market. Should their margins drop and growth slow these companies could struggle to ever reach their COVID hype highs. People thought companies like CSCO were the future in the 90s. Arguably INTC is another darling from a couple of decades ago that is now dying after having a good run.  Just don't underestimate what can change in a decade. When I think back a decade ago FB was loved by everyone. Now it seems kind of crazy to think people were actually interested enough in FB that they would make a movie about FB and Zuckerberg. But back then Zuckerberg was kind of seen as Elon is today, and hardly anyone one knew who Elon was in the early 2010s. Things will almost certainly change in ways you can't even imagine in a decades time. Big tech companies may be the future, but who knows who will be the big tech players of the next decade.](/r/stocks/comments/u1hvsq/realistically_where_do_you_see_the_stock_market/i4d0cse/)

"Again, I will promote Talga / TLG. Its a graphite miner, and battery anode producer, all in one go. Biggest potential production outside China, cheaper than synthetic anode and just as consistent due to a fluke of nature. Its risky in the sense that it doesnt yet has published customers, it doesnt got mining permits and it doesnt have a JV to build the mine. The market doesnt give that company justice and values it at $300M, at around $1 a share. But europe simply cant manage its CO2 and EV production goals without TLG. Its gonna explode once the above boxes are ticked.

I am 95% sure that they will 5x before end of 2023 and 20x before end of 2026. The dividends alone should exceed todays share price by 2027/28. Risk / reward is fantastic for this one.

Everything is bullish for that company. Talga is the only meaningful anode producer in Europe and all the battery cell factories that are currently build will want its product. I am sure VW/Northvolt is going to get a decent cut and Tesla maybe too, but probably not initially for the 4680 ramp.

Did you notice how Elon didnt mention anode recently when talking about battery components? There is a battle behind the scenes because demand exceeds production many fold. And you cant make it easily or fast.

[The fair value of a company and the market value are two different things. In theory they should converge but there are a number of factors that can cause them to diverge. So his valuation being different from the market price doesn't mean he is wrong per se, it means he is using different assumptions than the market. Whether he is correct or the market is correct is impossible to say presently, you can only make that determination retrospectively over a long enough time frame.  The valuation of TSLA specifically is highly dependent on assumptions since the company is expanding quickly and the EV market is immature.  There is a range of reasonable growth and margin assumptions you could make with TSLA that could change the valuation by orders of magnitude, which is why you see so much arguing between the bulls and the bears.](/r/stocks/comments/s4oral/aswath_damodarans_tsla_valuation_model/hst1kg3/)

[Completely agree and I've watched his videos about company valuations. The one I did more so agree with was Uber. He believed it had a fair value of only $40, and look where it's trading now.  Also for his TSLA analysis, you're completely right. His model considers very basic traditional car manufacturing stats like ""number of cars sold"". How about FSD, premium data connectivity subscriptions, their solar business? I could go on and on.  And times are changing. There very clearly is a premium for ""cult-like companies"" or ones with massive brand loyalty. AAPL, TSLA, NVDA. He doesn't include that either.   So many people think fundamental valuation is some fancy concept and learning it will make you a good investor.

[No one is hunting for bargain bin prices and including $SHOP in that search. Totally out of context. Of course if the EV trades at below book value by such a HUGE amount, it makes sense. But we are talking about tech in this context and waiting around for a larger fish to buy them. Not non-tech cos with traditional assets and book values attached. NO ONE can accurately peg those non-tangible values with enough certainty to go HAM.  Second, no one can replicate the godly performance level like Seth Klarman.   Third. One assumes book value is even accurate and marked to market. Like I said, it won‚Äôt occur at the $66B range. Maybe a $500M co with assets that can be liquidated, but not $SHOP/$SLACK level valuations.  Plus the market is valuing the expected decline of the business as a negative value to the businesses EV. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs trading at a discount. It‚Äôs cheap for a reason. Stop trying to take the last few puffs for free, you‚Äôll burn yourself.

"I was in at $200 pre split since 2015.  my financial planner at the time talked me out of putting in $20k as I had requested (10% of my whole nut at the time) and talked me down to $10k.  

When it shot up to $800 pre, he had me sell half and take profits.  Pandemic hit so I didn't buy back in at $400.  

Then I watched it go up and up and up, the whole time kicking myself.  I would have 400+ shares if not for shit financial advice.  I fired him over that.

"Hi there, I think I can talk about this given that it's a project that we are working on. The reason is that there are some really big problems with the current way of doing it. I will explain the reasons here. To begin, there are essentially three ways to bring stocks onto the blockchain:

1. Asset backed tokens: this is where a company purchases the shares themselves and creates digital tokens that can be traded. Kind of like how Tether (supposedly) backs up their stablecoin with real dollars. This is what is done by FTX and a few others.
2. Collateralized tokens: This is what is done by Synthetix and was done by [mirror.finance](https://www.mirror.finance/) (RIP). Essentially the idea here is that you take the price feed for a stock from somewhere like the NYSE or NASDAQ and create a digital version of a token that is pegged to that price feed and use something called overcollateralization which backs up the value of the token using money instead of the actual share itself. So for example you could have a pegged token of TSLA by creating a digital token and backing it up with $995.85 (where the current price is $663.90, that's an overcollateralization of 150%). The price then moves up and down with the price feed and the person that created the token adjusts the amount of money collateralizing it up and down. Overcollateralization is necessary because the price moves up and down and you always need to have enough money backing the token.

Before I talk about the third way I will talk about the problems with the first two. The problem with number 1 is that you still need a centralized entity to hold the shares. This means that it has to obey regulations worldwide which make it difficult to sell these stocks to everybody. E.g. tokenized stocks on FTX are restricted in many countries. The problem with number 2 is that you end up with a shittier version of the centralized exchange that defeats the point of what you are trying to do. What I mean by this is that you have to have developers in the loop to create each new market (because they have to connect the price feed) so it ends up being really slow to create new markets. You also get all the disadvantages of the centralized exchange, despite being decentralized - i.e. markets close, the US government still controls them etc. Finally, it's incredibly capital inefficient because of overcollateralization. i.e. to have $100 worth of TSLA you have to lock up &gt;$100 worth of capital. On Synthetix you have to lock up 600% of the value of the asset.

The third way, which is what we have built is to create entirely independent markets on these assets. What you are doing here is creating the stock market from scratch. You have a new TSLA market that exists only on the blockchain. It's entirely independent and not tied to the real company Tesla or the NASDAQ market on it. Price discovery happens on chain. The advantages of this is that it solves the regulatory problems of the first, the inefficiency and operation problems of the second, and you can expand the concept of an asset beyond simple stocks and commodities to anything - concepts, ideas, people etc. You also have markets that are completely decentralized, no developers needed or anything. I won't shill our project here but if you would like to know a bit more, send me a DM.

The last thing that I would say is that DeFi is still really hard to use if you aren't a technical person, so DeFi as a whole is suffering because of that. Most of the people that would benefit from access to tokenized stocks don't have the background (or desire) to go through that effort. That's something we have fixed by making a simple platform that hides all the Web3 stuff but there is still a long way to go in the industry in general.

TL;DR: The reason is that there are a lot of issues (both technical, regulatory, and related to capital inefficiency) with the current way tokenized stocks are implemented. Also, DeFi is hard to use so not many people use it. Tokenized stocks are already a small part of DeFi so this makes it even smaller.",positive
Also having this real tsla wacko affiliated with the NHTSA makes any litigation tesla might undertake against the agency so much easier. She is such an easy target.,positive
"&gt; But Cathie doesn‚Äôt let that natural process take place. She constantly sells Tesla on up days to dilute her funds with other stocks, that may not be nearly as strong. This destroys the entire purpose of a 5 year plan. 

Because her fund holds really large stakes in a lot of fairly illiquid small tech stocks.

On the way up, when they saw huge amounts of new cash coming into the fund, putting huge amounts of money into these relatively illiquid tech stocks drove prices up dramatically, but now that they're facing redemptions, they either have to sell off their illiquid trash and take a big loss on that, or they can sell their more liquid names and use the money to buy more illiquid trash, which drives the price of those names up temporarily and helps to stop the bleeding.

This is made worse because Nikko [also markets a fund mirroring ARKs positions](https://en.nikkoam.com/institutional/equity-strategies/nikko-am-ark-disruptive-innovation-strategy) and Sumitomo Mitsui (who own Nikko) also mirrors these positions further.

So now, they're stuck with some really huge stakes in some quite illiquid names, for example PagerDuty:

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PD/holders?p=PD

ARKK + Nikko + Sumitomo own &gt;25% of the shares, or ~30% of the float. The stock trades an average of 1.1 million shares per day, and these funds between them own &gt;22 million shares.

The funds can't easily sell a big part of their stake in any sort of hurry, because trying to sell several times the average daily volume would certainly crash the price. Therefore when they see significant redemptions, the only thing they *can* do is sell liquid stuff like TSLA.",positive

"So the crazy thing about Musk's networth - and the way our media calculates the networth of most billionaires - is that the majority of his wealth isn't in hard assets (though he has plenty of those) - but rather in his equity (ownership) of TSLA.  So what people do is they take the number of stock shares Musk owns and multiplies it by the current stock price of TSLA.

The current stock price of TSLA is inflated beyond any reasonable metric.  It's insane.  It's not based on any kind of normal valuation tied to Tesla's actual performance.  Most stocks are priced based on how much profit the company has earned in the last year.  If you take the price and divide by those earnings, you get something called a ""Price/Earnings Ratio"".  At the time I'm writing this comment: The average company stock in the stock market has a P/E of around 26.   Apple's is 26, Ford's is 24, GM's is 7, Toyota's is 9.  TSLA's is 363, which is just STUPID high - one of the highest ever seen in the stock market.  Other stocks with stupid high valuations still typically come in under 100 P/E - Netflix is at 62, Adobe at 53.

So you take this inflated stock price and multiply it by the stupidly large amount of shares Elon owns and people say that's what he's worth.  And so the number we express as Elon's NW turns out to be stupidly inflated because there's absolutely no way he'd be able to sell off his assets and turn them into that much cash.

But the problem here is that stock prices can go down, and if Elon were to attempt to liquidate too many of his shares at one time, that would drive the price of TSLA stock way, way down.  Fast.  And he would lose power at his own company as the percentage that he owns goes lower.  So he's incentivized to actually NOT sell off the shares.

So what typically happens with billionaires instead is that they borrow against their ownership.  They take out huge, low-interest loans and buy shit like yachts and mansions to enjoy - and then take out huge, low-interest loans against those things as well.

Is Elon stupid rich?  Absolutely yes.  Is he really as ludicriously rich as the media expresses?  No.  Because the price of TSLA is inflated beyond any kind of reason and one of two things will happen: Either TSLA revenue will have to grow to reach these expectations, or TSLA share prices are eventually going to fall like a rock during whatever the next market correction is.  And people who buy TSLA shares at $1000+ are going to be left holding the bag.",positive

"For the highly unusual TSLA split a few months ago, there was a run-up prior to the actual split, and the run up lasted many weeks. 

Most of the time, nothing happens, and you have the same value as before.  

In general, if you are confident of a move, out of the money gives more leverage and more risk of failing to have gain. 
You must always balance potential gain and potential risk of loss.",positive

I just got banned from real tesla for commenting to some dude who was posting links to giving to a Ukraine charity (which I do support) and that long TSLA holders who have made so much money should support. But then bragging about how he made 7 figures shorting Tesla and I suggested that a lot of that was due to Ukraine‚Ä¶ These people all salty douches or what? I mean they actually had a chance to buy this month‚Ä¶,positive
This would make more sense if 99% of TSLA holders weren‚Äôt in profit. Only ones getting squid game invites are who bought at 1250,positive
"It's been overvalued for forever. TSLA has been to the brink of bankruptcy yet nothing can kill the stock. Hertz announces they plan to buy 100,000 cars but there isn't even a deal in place and the stock rockets up over 1T market cap.

But the same thing can be said for a lot of things. Dogecoin has a market cap over Ford's but it's literally a shitcoin made to make fun of crypto and barely has any practical use as a crypto compared to other currencies, but people still buy it.

The only thing that can bring TSLA's valuation down to Earth is if Elon tries to cash in his entire stake.",positive
"All those ppl defending ARK below about buying into innovation/growth early and will eventually pan out have zero clue what ARK does.

They don't have conviction in their trades. They buy meme shit like WKHS, SPCE, FSLY and bails on them within months for big L. It's not even a secret. ARK post their trades transparently daily.

If they diamond hand them until the company executes, great. But ARK talks a big game about 5 years horizon but uses investor money and swing trades and tries to time the market, often failing spectacularly at it.

TSLA and other growth names like TDOC, SQ, ROKU, etc can only carry them so much. It is especially telling when those names pull back too.

You are not buying into an actively managed fund that does some amazing DD and figured out a proper entry to accumulate or take gains on. You're literally buying into someone who uses a significant portion of their inflows and capital to try and time the market with meme shit.",positive
Can someone tell me TSLa is trading at in Istanbul right now? Asking for a friend,positive
"I would ask what happens when:

1. Ford starts delivering F150 Lightnings
2. GM gets out of it's own way (Hummers ship)
3. VW keeps getting better at EV's
4. Any of the other top 5 auto manufacturers ship EV's
5. Evil TSLA ships cybertruck and then says hey, lets make a traditional truck

Can RIVN keep up on production and build new plants quickly (1 year each)?

Can RIVN keep up on technology IP gain?

Can RIVN Make batteries?

Can RIVN build a charger network?

Can RIVN handle the customer service model?

If the answer to the ""CAN"" questions is yes, then the sky is the limit for the stock.",positive
"It was, at 1 point, $400/share. At $200, compared to TSLA, it's not that outrageous since GME will create their own crypto exchange, send humans to the Andromeda, and develop a cure for dying, last I heard from the GME sub.",positive
"TSLA is been going sideway, but at some point will break out. if it gets to the 600s again Im in. Probably Jan 2023 calls or play NVDA the same way, as the AI is the ""OS"" of the robot.",positive

"I‚Äôve come to realize why a vast majority of intelligent people, despite knowing Tesla will be the largest company on earth, do not invest in TSLA. 

The YTD chart is exactly why - massive volatility. You all have said it infinite times in the past year. People can not stomach seeing their net worth fluctuate this much in the short term.

Thankfully over the past year, I have been hardened to it - and +/- 40% swings no longer phase me üòÇ

"[Not in the slightest, CEI has a completely new CEO, and this stock is very bullish, do not listen to the FUD or smear campaigns, it‚Äôs grossly oversold and will be in compliance with the SEC when the 10k is signed. The CEO has made it abundantly clear that it will not have anymore reverse splits   You‚Äôre looking at an oil penny stock that traded for cents on the dollar for years. Barring the reverse splits it‚Äôs highest trade was 10.00 per share. But now that they got a new CEO who has an AWESOME track record with running companies and has been very successful in the past. Camber energy has managed to absolve all of their debts and stay in the positive IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC.          They are also Acquiring Viking energy group. They will own 61% of that company. They are also specializing in clean and renewable energy. Investors should benefit from any company or stock that is pushing toward renewable energy, and companies like Camber will do even better! Also with traveling happening barring any Omicron variant issues, the demand for oil is increasing and price per barrel is going up. As reserves get used demand will increase and companies like camber will continue to move. ALSO over the past few days volumes has increased and it‚Äôs support levels have gone from .47 .68.          Secondly Camber successfully secured the IP license for patented carbon capture system. If you research any carbon capture patent out there, none of them is as efficient and streamlined as CEI‚Äôs patent. THIS WILL BENEFIT CRYPTO MINING AS WELL. This stock is oversold and it will start pricing in around winter  and really pick up speed as Omicron and inflation fears calm.         Once CEI MERGES WITH Viking energy this will lay to rest the age old debate of wether CEI is a competent company (WHICH IT IS) and should spark a huge run. COMPETING OIL COMPANIES WITH LESS TO OFFER AND NO CARBON CAPTURE TECHNOLOGY ARE TRADING FOR 25-250 per share! Elon musk offered 100Million dollars to the best carbon capture technology, he moved FROM California to Texas RIGHT NEAR CEI/Viking energy, he‚Äôs tweeted memes that included Viking themes and CEI AND VIKING STARTED FOLLOWING ELON ON TWITTER. THEN RECENTLY THERE WAS A SECRET INVESTOR OF YOU GUESSED IT 100M who agreed to put 50M in at 2.50 and the other 50m at 4 dollars. WONDER WHO CIULD THAT BE??        Even the worst case scenario for CEI is better than selling too early. I have been invested in CEI for 2 years. Every rumor and. Catalyst always came to fruition, I have watched this company rise from the ASHES, and Watched Doris remain CONSISTENT AND CONFIDENT. WE ARE SITTING ON SOMETHING MASSIVE. A wise man once told me it‚Äôs better to be in position when the market turns around than to be out and trying to buy back in. UNTIL THE FUNDAMENTALS NO LONGER MAKE SENSE. I‚Äôm holding for the long term. The night is always darkest before the dawn.](/r/pennystocks/comments/scl27g/is_camber_energy_cei_a_viable_penny_stock/hu8v04n/)

[Same here, my friend. I bought into TSLA at $250ish a share in 2019 before ALL of the stock splits because I believed in the company and have always been a Tesla fanboy - ya know, the real reasons people should buy stock. When the markets started to tank in March 2020, I held on for deal life until more the 75% of my gains vanished - price dropped from +900 to 400ish. Then I started to think maybe I could sell out before it hit bottom. Turns out I sold out at the exact fucking bottom before these assholes using Covid relief funds (aka SLR) bought up everything in sight. Naturally, as Covid news got worse I thought it made no sense and waited and waited to buy back my beloved shares. Ultimately, I didn‚Äôt buy back until it was too late. These were shares I never wanted to let go of. They‚Äôd be worth more than 400k by now. Fuck the markets. Fuck the regulators.

There's an HFT person in my trading group, they've been trading since the mid 90s. They use a 1 second chart and knows how the algorithms work. 1k-3k trades a day. Mostly TSLA, SPY, AAPL, and some momo. Hot keys make trades across multiple brokers. They rarely talk in group, but when they do, I write things down. 

What you need to learn is the micro patterns on the 1 minute. All of them, and there are a lot. Flags, HnS, Crown, wedges, scallops, and many more, and the fibonacci levels that work off of those. Where the algos take profits, fib wise.

Hot key fibonacci retracement and extensions to mouse buttons then when you recognize a pattern setup, use fibs to see your profit taking and stop loss.

[&gt;I've been eyeing MSFT like a hawk, yet I always think it's too high. Then it jumps again!  Ha ha are you me? That's what's been fucking me up for months. The ""problem"" with Microsoft is that it rarely has major dips.   Finally at around $262 I said ""fuck it"" and pulled the trigger. That was an all-time-high at the time mind you. Now it's up 26%.  I think one story people don't talk about enough with regards to Microsoft is their competitiveness in cyber security. I don't know if they're the best, but certainly it's easy for them to cross-sell their cyber security offerings to a company that's already using their office or cloud services. So even if Microsoft isn't best in class, the sales funnel is very sticky for them.

Hopefully, TSLA will end up dragging NIO and XPEV's sp's up. But in no way is NIO incredibly oversold or undervalued.

Now, maybe delivery numbers in a few days will provide a boost. But overall, if the sp dropped to $20, it would still be overvalued on any number of metrics. So sliding around $35-55 is not about incredibly undervalued. It can get undersold on a technical basis... and I have some short term calls in case that turns out to be true. But I unloaded most of them when the weakness was clear last week, and added a bit on weakness today. But there's a massive difference between hourly/daily trading action and the overall story.

[This is purely anecdotal, but prior to the 'reopening' I couldn't walk down a WMT aisle without seeing one of their pick-up/delivery employees putting together a huge cart of orders.  Now I can't remember the last time I saw even a single one.    Also my local WMT installed a massive automated pickup tower at the entrance.  You'd scan your smartphone on arrival and small orders would be dropped out of the tower, or if it was a big order a nearby locker would pop open.  It was actually very cool.  But it's been completely shutdown for several months now, I'm guessing just waiting to be dismantled.    Again this is all anecdotal.  But if other WMT's are like mine WM+ (and online push) doesn't seem to have been the AMZN killer some have speculated on.    I think WMT is a stock that you could own for life and never lose sleep over... but is it going to have some kind of breakthrough and become a growth stock?

"The thing that is specific to funds (Mutual Funds, Hedge Funds, ETFs) is Assets Under Management as I said originally. It's one thing for a fund to invest $10m and get outsized returns, another thing for $100m, and another thing for $50b. The AUM for ARKK has grown massively throughout 2020, from about $2b to over $50b currently.

So there is more capital (25x more from 18 months ago) and a fairly limited number of opportunities to fit their investment thesis around disruptive innovation. Furthermore, often the innovative/disruptive companies are on the smaller side and it becomes hard to manage your positions risk when you take a majority stake, as your transactions can materially move the stock price which causes panic.

It's highly unlikely that the performance that ARKK had in 2020 with $2b AUM will be sustainable with $50b+ in my opinion. 

I suspect this is part of the reason Burry is short, in addition to the fact that the fund holds some of the highest price/sales growth stocks in the market, similar to TSLA which is actually 10% of ARKKs holdings making them highly correlated.

Full disclosure - I follow Burry closely but I rarely hold short positions unless it's a hedge. I think he's probably right that yields or interest rates will make TSLA and ARKK fall at some point, but determining when is very tricky and speculative.",positive

"[If you are looking for timing, then avoid. The reason is home sales are slowing and will continue slowing for a while. Also disposable income is sliding.  So overall, the macro is not favorable for renovations and hardware in general.

[Its not about ‚Äúremodeling‚Äù going away, its about the valuation behind a company that sells the goods for remoddeling, thats absurd. I dont understand why people keep trying to justify buying X cause its not going away. A good company does not equal a good stock. HD has terrific dividend growth, but will be slightly less div growth in the future. It has a staggering cagr as is but will be lower. I bought more of HD after their 15% div hike (the day the price per share dropped 8%) but u have to realize that these prices (since 2020) were in a perfect scenario. Fed was buying billions a month, housing boom cause of very low intrest + covid had people spending less (couldnt go on trips, outside in general) thus most spent it on renovations or along those lines. We will not see these perfect conditions in our life again. However with time HD will be able to justify the current prices. Just dont be surprised these stocks that trade at a big premium will have a rocky few years. HD is not a ‚Äúdeal‚Äù right now.

[I say it is trading at a premium because shareholders were used to double digit growth. Last week they released their report and shared their 2022 guidance. I copy pasted this from the official website for you: Fiscal 2022 Guidance: Sales growth and comparable sales growth to be slightly positive Operating margin approximately flat with fiscal 2021 Net interest expense of approximately $1.5 billion Tax rate of approximately 24.6 percent Diluted earnings-per-share-growth to be low single digits  HD fell 8% (i believe) after the report that day. Now you can go to the website MacroTrends and look for HD Pe ratio. It fell from 25 to 21. Pe ratio is not everything but its a useful metric to keep in mind to evaluate a company. HD began considerably growing 2010. Pe ratio was 10-20 2010-2015 and then averaged 20-21 next few years. This was all with double digit growth. Now we have singular digit growth. It does not warrant a 20+ pe ratio which is why i think it is trading at a premium.](/r/stocks/comments/t1ztq1/is_home_depot_hd_a_good_buy_at_current_price_bull/hyo3i4l/)

Does that influence people in the real world? Absolutely! Just look on Reddit, where every week there is a post from someone thinking about getting into the market and they are thinking of buying NVDA, TSLA, and 3 other names in the top 15. It's almost always the same companies that you see on TV, over and over. 

Also, on a daily basis, ask yourself: how does a station decide which stock tickers to display at the bottom of the screen? What are the criteria? That criteria is decided upon by humans, who usually stand to make or lose money because of the influence they provide.

"Tesla's brand is important, and that would be damaged by damage to Musk/Twitter.  This impacts sales, recruiting, and access to capital.

Elon needs to commit about $40B in TSLA shares as collateral for the $20B loan.

Keep in mind that he is paying 50% more for the company than it was worth a month ago on the open market.

"Horse beaten to death in this sub.

CSP, CC and PCS/CCS are all different strategies, even if they seem to be all just ""theta"".

Your TSLA spread is not theta but a delta play. You have basically no theta decay on a 1 wide 0DTE spread like that and you will need to hold it into expiration to make a profit. If TSLA ran up more on open, you're losing the spread.

A CSP and CC require more capital, but also offers more gross premium return and flexibility in rolling out to salvage. You also benefit highly from theta and delta and can close based on both. You commit more money but also more ways to profit.

A PCS/CCS have minimal theta decay especially if you have 1 wide strikes, meaning your short and long legs decay at nearly the same rate, so you will make very little from theta and will usually need to hold to expiration. This creates substantially more delta risk with gamma being a major problem in the last few days unless you're just super deep ITM.

To make more from PCS/CCS you therefore need to hold longer, and also have more fixed risk. If your TSLA position got blown up, rolling it is basically not possible. You are taking that max loss.

Selling spreads is a step above in terms of leveraging your capital. Running 0DTE spreads like this is basically flipping a coin because you have zero time to recover. 

TLDR: You are missing the hugely elevated risk of narrow spreads which increase your risk of max loss by a large margin if the stock moves against, and by over-leveraging by selling a lot of spreads you can blow up your account chasing higher ROR. 0DTE spreads are basically crap-shoots. Stock moves against you, you're taking max loss.",negative

"If the notional value denominating a given crypto isn't closely correlated with real world financial impact, then what are all those suicidal people who lost all their money on Luna/UST getting impacted by? Ponzi schemes must, at some level, pay out real money to early adopters in order to onboard new suckers. If they never paid out anything and made anyone rich, they would have no takers.  

The same goes for your argument about crypto billionaires not being billionaires. Crypto billionaires are people with *financial power*, who misuse that power to enrich themselves and satisfy their own egos, regardless of how many people their actions will hurt now and in the future. Having billions on paper in terms of digital wealth isn't all that different than having billions tied up in the equity of a grossly overvalued meme company. TSLA stock might as well be a crypto token given how far divorced it is from what Tesla actually does as a car manufacturer, yet shitposter extraordinaire Elon Musk can find enough believers in the worth of his stock holdings to amass the capital needed to buy one of the biggest social media platforms on the internet, where he'll likely set the rules for who gets to speak on it and how. That's real power, even if the wealth is fake. The same applies to crypto. People believed in Do Kwon because he built an 18 billion dollar algo stablecoin promising infinite riches, and had fuck you money to flip off his critics. If he was just some poor guy who ran a shitcoin with a tiny market cap, nobody would have taken him seriously.  

Also, if crypto could represent a contagion risk to traditional finance at *any* point, then the facilitators of that risk *must* have influence over traditional finance, even if their wealth is tied up in magic internet beans. You can't have it both ways. If this is just all pretend, then by definition nobody can get hurt by it, and ""crypto billionaires"" like Sam Bankman-Fried can't possibly do things like buy stakes in traditional finance companies or donate to political campaigns with hundreds of millions in fiat dollars, since all he does is trade and facilitate the trading of magic internet beans all day long. By your logic, there's no way for him to have gotten that money and influence in the first place. Today's major players within the crypto space have used their control and accumulation of digital tokens to become extremely wealthy, and they've used that wealth to the detriment of others. Crypto critics should not ignore that fact.  

But I find your first point strangest of all. Of course the collapse of Terra happened for a reason. Explaining those reasons in detail before it happens to the people who are on the fence and don't understand the scheme but thought it might have potential is how you convince them otherwise. The truth of the matter is, a lot of people have been seduced by the various narratives coming out of crypto, a lot, enough to have seen the believers collectively sink billions of fiat dollars into this space and make even monkey jpeg pointers a thing that gets talked about in the news. If your ability to counter those ""we're all gonna make it"" narratives starts and ends at ""but all crypto is a scam, just trust me bro,"" how convincing do you think you'd sound?  

If a friend came to you at the height of the Anchor scheme asking if it's legit, do you just tell them it's a ponzi, or explain *how* it's an unsustainable ponzi? Do you walk them through the inflationary death spiral of algo stablecoins to show them exactly how a price collapse would go down, or just say it's a scam and let them figure it all out? Terraform Labs made a lot of noise over how it's not just the future of internet money, but also a vibrant developer ecosystem that's on the cutting edge of the internets, forming a community of builders creating the future of finance. And it works, investors get sucked into those narratives and start trusting the scammers, or else it wouldn't have gotten nearly to the size that it did. In the face of all those dazzling lights, how believable would a dismissive ""all crypto is a scam that's bound to collapse, just trust me bro"" sound to anyone who doesn't understand the dirty underbelly of crypto?",negative

[&gt; I've been cautioned to avoid picking individual stocks as I have no idea. Would you agree that picking individual stocks is dicey?  Dicey if you don't know why you are buying a stock or don't have help. There are online stock pickers who sell stock recommendations to subscribers. I don't buy everything they recommend but my market-beating individual stocks came from such subscriptions.  Since you have an account at Schwab one thing you could do to see if individual stocks are for you with a very small investment is to take advantage of Schwab's Stock Slices program https://www.schwab.com/fractional-shares-stock-slices  You can buy fractional (&lt;1 share) shares of stocks for as little as $5 each. For as little as $100 you could own fractional shares of 20 different companies. If you can afford to dedicate $100 in your account to individual stocks, try putting $5 into each of the following companies with Schwab Stock Slices and then see how that portfolio of stocks does compared to your S&amp;P 500 index ETF after 1 year:  MRNA FTNT F NVDA IT ANET IRM TSLA ETSY AMD ZBRA NOW ODFL AAPL MSFT POOL NFLX IDXX GOOGL COST  You could also add companies that your are familiar with like Amazon (AMZN), Starbucks (SBUX), or Domino's Pizza (DPZ) for $5 each.  The S&amp;P 500 had an above-average year last year, it seems unlikely it would have back-to-back above-average years.

If $tsla $5000 that means $239bn goes to the government. By the time he dies the government will have cashed in on 68% of his 20% share ownership of tesla. Why would he do this if he didn't care about taxes. You keep proving my point. ""Because it's the most lucrative for his pocket, he don't care about paying taxes"".

"It may be Tesla, but there's competition, and that competition isn't some scrawny startup in SF.   


Waymo, backed by google has more money than God. They're self driving program started out of Google X when TSLA was still figuring out how to get electric motors from AC propulsion. I do not doubt the caliber of TSLA's AI team, but to say that google is non competitive would be wrong.   


Chip Shortage - Yup, TSLA has they're own hardware. Google, Argo, Cruise, Mobileye likely buys it from one of the major manufacturers. Kudos to TSLA to devving their own hardware. Everyone else is likely specing the hardware.   


They have complete control over the Code, revisions, hardware. Really? And the companies that may sell the a self driving box to every major manufacturer do not? Yes, it's better integrated in the car, no doubt.   


See, while TSLA might make shit for themselves, the competitors are making stuff for everyone. Economies of scale will kick in and pricing will likely be significantly cheaper. Imagine making 5 million of TSLA autopilot vs 25M of Mobileye's self driving system.   


I'm still long TSLA though :P

"Nord, I think fundamentally you're more cynical than I am or probably most of the SC userbase. After all, there is a self-selection effect happening where people who can tolerate an alpha (or pledge to support it) are going to be more open-minded, agreeable, confident in CIG, CR, and SC, but that doesn't mean they're naive. I think your points are either cynical or at least, uncharitable‚Äîincluding your assessment of me. You're also engaging in a bit of binary thinking.

&gt;My point is the same through entire discussion - CIG is yet to prove themselves.

This is a fundamental concept you get wrong. SC has already had the most successful Kickstarter of all time. Proof of concept/interest. People have been playing SC as long as there has been a public alpha. I've been playing since 2015 and I am also an Evocati tester, and I don't wring my hands wondering when they will prove themselves. The game has merit right now and has for years in various forms and to varying degrees. What you're waiting for, perhaps for your neurotype....is far too conservative for others.

This is why I assumed you to be a programmer, or someone who is much more literal in your thinking than one who assesses and recognizes patterns and trends. But, this literal kind of thinking is why people still don't understand TSLA stock. Literal thinkers wouldn't have purchased Amazon stock before Amazon was profitable‚Äîand I was around when they spent years operating at a loss. Investors who saw trends bought the stock and made a mint. Those who rely on charts and graphs miss the soft science of trends and human behavior in large groups, often. I'm not saying we don't need charts and graphs people, but you will miss a lot being so linear in your approach.

&gt;Generating ""buzz"" or having high fidelity, cool tech game means nothing if not supported by gameplay.

False dichotomy fallacy. There is gameplay right now. It's not finished but it's not like people are flying in ships with nothing to do. Flying in ships is something to do, incidentally.

You assume incorrectly that the buzz around Star Citizen is based on nothing, or based solely on visuals (partially true). There are gameloops too. It's not just ScreenShot Citizen. And remember, it's alpha. You should know that this means the game (and it is a game) is neither feature complete or content complete. Lots of gameplay tuning happens in alpha. SC just happens to be a public alpha with the largest QA and focus group ever. Most games as you know don't see the light of day before beta, if that.

&gt;With current gameplay this game will be dead and forgotten a year after release. I've been a baker since the KS and I saw hype and hype dying out - even the current backer audience (which is the most favorable towards the game) mostly dry up couple month after a new patch release

Now who's going on 'feel'? Yes, there is a surge with every patch, and every free fly event...and every Xenothreat...and soon with other events. There's more than one free-fly event per year now, more than one sales opportunity (November being the big ship sales event) and all of the patches we've seen are cumulative. Keep that in mind. New players coming to the 'Verse have ALL of the content to-date, where we only had a trickle when the hangar modules were released...with A/C, the early PU, etc. So, there's a lot more to keep new players engaged.

Much of the buzz we see is the contrast between current SC and its cumulative content vs, the 'competition'; a botched E:DO release, NMS being a totally different look and feel, X4 being a single-player game with sub-standard art, and little else that directly competes with SC.

Now, why would someone coming to current (let's say post Orison-release) SC not have a strong reaction when there's so much to see and do, alpha or not? When the game is working it's brilliant, but it's not complete (we know this). But, it's so much more 'complete' now than it's ever been simply through cumulative man-hours and added content. Of course this will create more buzz and player retention than prior patches, and I expect this ebb and flow to continue all the way through release....but there will always be more to retain players over they years. Released games also have ebb and flow, btw.

&gt;I am not cynical, I am pragmatic and I want people to temper their expectations. I've heard ""this is where it all comes together"" far more than once for years. No, it's not. Once the tech is done, it's where it just begins.

I think you believe that you are pragmatic, but I see a lot of cynical negative-thinking, and I don't think all criticism is negative, nor do I think all 'negativity' is bad. But, I'm seeing a bit of uncharitable descriptions of my assessment too. The game is coming together more than ever before, which is why I keep talking about 'critical mass'. Where CMDRs were once more critical of SC (assuming one-game played at a time), we're seeing a huge and steady stream of E:DO refugees raving about both SC as a game and the community too (being friendly, helpful). I read this sub often and I always read the new player stories. I'm seeing a big uptick, and again there's more content than ever to see just because more time has passed, more content is in than ever before. It's cumulative.

&gt;My opinion of you is not an ad hominem, I am just pointing out that your belief is unfounded and serves as self-referencing proof, which is a definition of faith (not religion - faith doesn't necessary had to be about diety of sorts). You talk about buzz, but there are tons of examples of buzz for games that have ultimately failed.

You think it's unfounded, but I've explained why I think you're wrong. That's the primary contention here. Your opinion vs. my opinion of the game, the buzz, the trends, where things are going, contrast between SC and the competition, etc.

I was explaining that I'm not a person who runs on faith, and I have probably have less faith than you on any number of topics...maybe not though. We may be similarly fact-driven but for our different takes on SC's past, current, and future success. I also don't use 'faith' outside of religious context because it sends the wrong message. This is also a bit of a strawman from you, because faith assumes someone believing in something without any evidence. CONFIDENCE is the word I'd use, or pragmatic provisional support with caveats. I don't 'faithfully' support CIG, I have confidence in them. Please understand the difference. Note, this is again you being cynical and uncharitable in your characterization of my views.....and saying I have 'faith' in the project is a step away from the Cult accusation we backers get so often. That's not lost on me, even if it's lost on you. I could be cynical and presume your intentional passive-aggression here.

&gt;There are examples of silent hits. Buzz is not a reliable indicator without analyzing what's causing it - I see what - that's the potential, but the product at hand. And much like in other cases, if that potential would fail to realize - that buzz will turn negative.

You seem to forget that CIG has already been through a tsunami of negative buzz and FUD, just like Tesla. I'm also a Tesla-owner and we have to fight off constant FUD here too often based on ignorance and disinformation, and sometimes cynicism or political agendas (big oil, opposing interests). CIG is now coming \*out\* of that FUD because of its work, and the evidence is in the game which is both LIVE right now and on the PTU. The game is OUT right \*now\*, but it just happens to be in the form of a public alpha. There's no need to wait to form an opinion about it, just as thousands have....including E:DO refugees.

&gt;I'm a game engine programmer, and I worked on AAA games, popular RPGs and MMOs, so I know very well that tech (including rendering) doesn't make a game.

I assumed from your tone that you were a programmer type. I think your analysis is a bit too literal and clinical, mixed with some cynicism, but it misses obvious trends or less-obvious patterns. Of course you've said you thought I was idealistic and naive, but that's the root of our disagreement isn't it? I've worked on AAA games too, btw, and like I said I did that for 28 years before transitioning to AR/VR/cinematics, etc. Of course, I'm on the 3D art side, and despite our common background there will be neurotypical differences between engine programmers and 3D artists. Even without these categories, clearly we have two different interpretations of the data here.

&gt;I don't know who you are, probably an artist of sorts - either by profession or by calling, but the views you've expressed are very naive and idealistic.

I'm your boss. JK. Your opinion of course, and I've given you mine. Why don't we wait and see what happens eh? Orison is going to create more of this buzz I'm talking about, as it already has from those playing the PTU.

Tell me why I should buy LCID with all the tandem risks associated with a negative cash flow company as opposed to mature plays like Ford? Not that I'd ever invest in car companies in the first place: intensive capital, abysmal margin, pitiful dividend to nonexistent even with low PE.

Btw, with 700 billion (TSLA market cap), I can buy Ford, GM, Toyota, Volkswagen and still have about 100 billion leftover. Now that is crazy.

"So how do you choose to explain Tesla‚Äôs higher 30% gross margin‚Ä¶. but a relatively normal 9-13% net margin? Tesla is just bad at cost control? Not efficient? Not good at money? Lost it all on Bitcoin?

Let‚Äôs review:


(Tesla) net margins (GM):

(3.09%) Q1 2021 (7.34%)

(5.14%) Q2 2021 (9.00%)

(7.04%) Q3 2021 (8.36%)

So, for the first three quarters of 2021, GM had higher net margins than Tesla. GM won‚Äôt have their earnings call until Feb 1st, so we can‚Äôt compare Q4 quite yet.

"I think you can get good exposure to Tesla (I would even say, a disproportionate exposure) via a sector-specific fund like iShares' IDRV. I firmly believe that EVs are going to be similar to PCs and smart phones - in my lifetime, PCs / laptops were not a thing and neither were smart phones (I used to make calls on rotary phones so I'm of a certain... vintage). The change has actually been so gradual that it is impossible to notice - until one day the past seems totally foreign. I think in 2040, we are going to have that with EVs, it is just a big, inevitable trend that is going to happen (at scale) - you're either on the right side or on the wrong side of that trend.

The problem is, how do you guess if Tesla is still around? Elon is a key person risk - that company fundamentally changes if something happens to him. Is Rivian going to overtake them in that space - truck sales in NA are the hottest thing and they were first to market. Ford? NIO? GM? You get the problem, it's always the same problem - preservation of capital, curbing of downside, maximizing of upside vs. survivorship of a single stock.

IDRV has a heavy skew towards TSLA, but it also gives you other options, in case things go awry.",negative

"Not trying to be mean, but If I were YOU I wouldn‚Äôt listen or trust my opinion. 

You said ‚ÄúThis has to be somewhere near the bottom I believe‚Äù if I was a betting man I would bet you said the same statement when they were down 30%, 40%, 50%, and 60%. Obliviously being down as much as you are means your timing was wrong. If your now comfortable cutting your loss down 40%, you should‚Äôve cut your loss down 40% originally. There‚Äôs really know reason why anyone as a retail trader should sit in a stock down 10%. If you get stopped out at 10% that means your timing was wrong, BUT to recover the 10% loss is manageable because then your next trade all you would have to do is get a stock that goes up 11% and there‚Äôs a thousand of stocks that do that within a year. Basically if your loss gets to big you‚Äôre digging yourself a hole that‚Äôs hard to climb out of because you‚Äôll need a stock to go up entirely to much just to get back at breakeven. For example if you‚Äôre in a stock that‚Äôs down 70% you need for it to go up 233%. Now how many stocks that you own is capable of doing that and if it were to go up that much, would you still be in it for the entire ride? So next time you‚Äôre down 10% just sell at a loss. You can always buy stock back later. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with taking a 10% loss because that‚Äôs how you avoid 70% losses. 

If you put your money in VTI or VOO you‚Äôll probably wouldn‚Äôt recover that loss until your 60s or 70s (assuming your in 20s or 30s). 

Stop listening to people and learn how to read charts and you‚Äôll be fine investing and you‚Äôll probably find some sleeper companies that will be the next TSLA 10yrs from now. 

I hate to tell you to cut your loss now because you‚Äôre down so much. But the quicker you cut your losses the faster you‚Äôll be able to wipe your hands clean and get a fresh start. 

Best of luck to you.",negative

That's not what makes me an idiot. I don't BASE MY PURCHASES on it. It's part of the decision but not all of it.

Nor do I buy American small-arms, again for the reasons of them having a financial incentive to take no action to prevent many shootings of many children. 
But I'm not going out of my way to yolo everything into TSLA - it's an overvalued company being run by a toddler who uses Twitter as his investor relations platform. It is not a great investment. It fails the screen.

They have their car set up to where if you actually get into an accident it wont total the car instantly as opposed to TSLA or other EV cars if you ""bump"" the charge port thats an instant total loss of the vehicle generally speaking..

Outside of the actual ""car"" they will 100% have the best battery tech in the game for the range of the cars.. they will outperform competitors in that aspect alone. They are doing the same thing that TSLA did where they will sell their premium high end cars first to raise capital before they produce the cheaper versions of the cars which will take a while. TSLA does have ""first mover"" advantage on them however that will only go so far.. companies like VW/Ford/LCID/RIVN ect.. watch them let them make the mistakes then proceed to just not do what they did... i.e production issues ect..

This strategy worked perfectly last year while market was steadily going up, but when the market turned I got caught on the wrong side, tried to collect $4k in premium from weeklies and got margin called two days later for -$12k.

Much of the media is controlled by billionaires with a financial incentive for directing the narrative. TSLA is the second most shorted stock in history.

Business Insider is the source of many unproven rumors such as the ""Apartheid Emerald Mines"" and the recent sexual harassment allegations. They continually pump out hit pieces about Tesla, leading me to suspect that their owner must have some financial incentive.

"TLRY wasn't a short play in the beginning and its January involvement makes it meme stock. 

TLSA did exactly what a growing business coming out of a short squeeze was suppose to do. TSLA dropped 16% before it exploded in August 2020. The run up from June to August is what broke the camels back. Shorts doubled down during the 2020 covid crash and when it climbed higher than before the squeeze was on. It experienced the 16% drop the day before it jumped back up 14% This was the kick off to the squeeze. 

TSLA is a very interesting short squeeze to look at because it's what happens when a squeeze occurs in a stock with people who believe in that company. Normally a squeeze happens, price sky rockets and then it goes back to where it was. TSLA kept climbing. It's what is going to happen to GME.

Many top comments on articles are people complaining about the amount of Tesla/musk ""news"" flooding the sub (and pointing out that the articles often have nothing to do with 'technology', ostensibly the focus of the sub), however said articles are always massively upvoted. 

Other top comments are the usual tired bad faith arguments about build quality (as I understand it no longer really a problem) or criticism of musk (much of which is fair) being used as an attack on Tesla itself (not exactly reasonable).

Would be very interested to know the mods financial positions with regards to TSLA or competition... Something unusual is definitely going on there.",negative

"i sold 5 BTC ($5k average price) at a slight loss, tsla 220 calls (pre-split) for only 20k, and several other investments where i ""could've"" made hundreds of thousands if i just held. sht used to cause me physical pain when i thought about it. everything gets better with time imo, just don't dwell on it",negative
"Totally valid worry, and i feel the same way re rooting for the stock not too go too high etc. In my case (and i am sure in yours too) the even bigger worry is that assignment means taxes and in my case they are 33%. Dont have that kind of money lying around, so stupid to get paid few hundreds, get assigned and essentially loose 1/3 of the position due to taxes.

But as a counterargument, considering your number of chairs you can sell ridiculously far out strikes and still bring in very decent money per week. For example lets say 1550C for next friday, selling CC's nets 100$/contract, so in your case it would be 4600 per week... And today is a terrible day premium wise. Can TSLA jump 35% in little over a week? Possible. Likely? Not very... Even taking half the premium for even further out strikes, that is still like 10k per month. But as a fellow TSLA chair holder and someone who has struggled alot whether to bother or not selling CC's on TSLA, just something to think about.",negative

10 contracts of amzn 3700-4200 bear call,

TSLA on the move leading EVs üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ,negative
"In 2019 SunRun was leading US solar with around 10% market share.  SunRun is currently valued at $9B-$10B.  We paid $5B for solar city, basically buy selling what is now $80B worth of stock.  

At the same time, tesla drove solar city‚Äôs 30% market share down to less than SunRuns current 10%.  And my guess is the gap has widened since 2019 and tesla has not significantly improved solar output since then other than likely on cost of deployments (overall solar deployments are still less than half of 2016).

Even if tesla becomes the market leader? They still will likely Not fill in the lost $80B of tsla value with solar over the next decade.  That would require them to deploy 5x-10x the amount of SunRun depending on margins.  

2016 kicked off a lost decade for tesla solar.  Hopefully by 2026 tesla solar can justify at least $50B valuation to show some progress.  But I highly doubt it.  And I highly doubt it will beat the return of the other sectors of tesla by 2030.

"No I never short, I am a smart guy trying to save stupid suckers from falling for the crypto BS.  And yes I know Musk is smarter than me, but he is also an eccentric with streaks of reckless self destruction in him. and he can afford to lose a few billion.  Can you afford to lose another 50% or more?   cryptos have no value at all except in the minds of suckers.  

Actually that's not true, for now many still have value. But maybe not for longer. Intrinsically they have no value as any economist will assure you.  Paul Krugman considers them similar to subprime mortgages.  I see them more like Enron's market of hot air, buying futures in things that don't even exist in the real world.  Enron was the best stock in the market for a few years, then SPLAT, went to zero.  I would also avoid TSLA, about 400% overvalued.  The BMW SV's look cooler and he just got 12 satellites destroyed.  Howard Hughes type. It didn't end well for Hughes and it won't end well for cryptos or any other pyramid scheme or investment in the ether.

Ether-ium?   CryptoworldCON?   BITcoin?  (very small shrinking bit) .  Stable (as if) coin? Doggydoocoin?  They even name themselves after frauds and pyramid schemes. Like a parody of themselves.  So obviously a scam.  None of it ever made any real sense and it peaked during covid lockdowns along with 1000% overvalued meme stocks suckering kids in whp had nothing else to do. Wake up.  It is just a foolish gambling addiction. NOT REAL.

Case in point, this typical story today.  ""Crypto scams are painful for investors, and it seems they are becoming more common. Why? More people are now embracing digital assets than ever before. As a result, scammers have a sea of targets ripe for the picking. Because of this, investors must be diligent when researching new projects. Promises of big gains might be enticing, but there‚Äôs always a possibility that one gets caught holding the bag. Baby Musk Coin (BABYMUSK-USD) reminds us of this reality today, as the BABYMUSK crypto plunges nearly 100%.""",negative

Tell that to TSLA,negative
"Yes it is capped at a 1K loss, since the width is $10. He sold it for 1.08 and it's currently at 7.80, so he is sitting at an unrealized loss of around $ 650-700 currently. His max loss is somewhere around $900 (since he received $108 to initiate the trade and 1k is the max distance).

To OP, well you can just take the loss, unless your assumption didn't change (I.e you still want to be short TSLA). Or, since it's already at a large loss percentage wise, you can just leave it and risk the remaining $100 or so for a miracle that TSLA would dump significantly in the next two weeks.",negative

"I'm not a stan. I'm bearish on TSLA. 

I will continue to try to educate you on how the legal system works, but if you're not interested, just stop reading.

Any type of lawsuit will require the plaintiff to demonstrate a number of factors are met. I don't have 30 minutes to look through this complaint and read the relevant California statutes, so let's just say that the plaintiff has to demonstrate (1) defendant owed a duty of care to the employees [this is pretty easy to prove] and (2) defendant breached that duty of care.

There are a million ways to show that the defendant breached the duty of care. One way would be to say that they didn't fire bosses who used racial slurs, even though they knew about it. Another way would be to say they didn't clean up graffiti promptly, even though they knew about it. Another way would be to say that they knew about racist managers assigning less desirable jobs based on race.

To win the lawsuit, you don't have to prove all 3. You just have to prove 1. It's to the plaintiff's advantage to list as many ways as possible (within reason) that the defendant breached their duty. You miss every shot you don't take.

When a market pays high PE for years ,  maybe you should take a step back and ask why is market paying such high PE in first place.

Any high school guy can see that, if you extrapolate the EPS of Tesla, at the current price, TSLA will be around 100 PE by next year. How‚Äôs that a bubble ?

"FTR, I am very bullish on TSLA the ticker.  The sentiment is extremely powerful.  Elon has a Jobs-esque marketing genius to him as well.  He can single-handedly move the several trillions plus entire cr!pto market with a tweet.

However, based on the limited evidence we have, it is almost entirely a car company TODAY and at least for several years.

Could that change?  Sure.  But Google buying up shares of IonQ doesn't make them a company just around the corner to dominate quantum computing.

So as a car company, future projections of absurd margins simply do not add up.  100 years of economic history in the auto industry all points to the same thing.  Swapping out an ICE and instead power the car with a battery doesn't change a god damn thing.  It is a cyclical business with razor thin margins and fiercely competitive.  No one wants to drive the same car as everyone else.",negative

"Elon Musk only pushing conservative memes while ignoring the right has become more extreme and moved farther than liberals in America because he cares about ""free speech"":

&gt;Elon Musk keeps tweeting that he loves free speech. So here's a thread with just a few of the countless examples showing he couldn't care about it less (üßµ)

&gt;5. Then there's the time Tesla **asked China to censor comments that were critical of the company.** https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-07-05/tesla-s-fall-from-grace-in-china-shows-perils-of-betting-on-beijing

https://twitter.com/JoshuaPotash/status/1519040404087320578

&gt;Elon Musk personally cancels blogger's Tesla order after 'rude' post

https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/03/elon-musk-blogger-tesla-motors-model-x

&gt;I‚Äôm old enough to remember when Elon Musk ordered his private investigators to make a Tesla employee‚Äôs life a living hell‚Äîincluding having the employee SWATTED‚Äîfor tipping off a reporter to waste at a Tesla factory.

&gt;The employee had to move his family to Hungary for safety.

https://twitter.com/nicoleperlroth/status/1518569530217226241

&gt;so one day in Musk is already cheering on a notorious white nationalist and Pizza Gater as he tries to get a Twitter employee fired over yet another sludge brain conspiracy theory. you can fancy up a frat bro with billions and yet

https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1519281896739508230

&gt;cries about twitter censorship on twitter

&gt;fires employee for using twitter

&gt;Goes on podcast and smokes a joint.

&gt;Fires someone for smoking a joint off hours.

https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/u3kwsx/ualexchii_does_the_math_that_elon_musk_getting_a/i4psz03/

&gt;So, you‚Äôve got $44B lying around. What do you do with it?

&gt;‚ùå Pay back California taxpayers, who subsidized your company‚Äôs growth before you picked up &amp; moved to TX

&gt;‚úÖ Buy Twitter b/c people are mean to you on it

https://twitter.com/Scott_Wiener/status/1518970937219067904

* Musk buys shares of Twitter around $35.
* Musk series of Tweets critical of Twitter, asking whether they thought Twitter was protecting free speech. ‚ÄúThe results of this poll will be important. Please vote carefully.‚Äù while continuing to buy shares.
* Musk exceeds the 5% threshold for SEC disclosure but continues buying without disclosing. (late disclosure added ~$150M to his profit)
* Musk disclosed his stake, Twitter shares rose 27% to $50/share.
* Musk offers buyout, shares soared 18% in pre-market trading.
* YOU ARE HERE

&gt;All of this while being forbidden by the SEC to make any comment that appears to be market related.

&gt;But I don't think he will resell his stocks. He really wants to buy Twitter, because he has recognized that Twitter is an excellent platform to manipulate stocks and cryptos.

&gt;3. In 2019, The New York Times reported that Jeffrey Epstein was ""advising Tesla‚Äôs embattled chief executive, Elon Musk, who was in trouble after announcing on Twitter that he had lined up the funding to take Tesla private."" 
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/business/jeffrey-epstein-interview.html

&gt;5. During Ghislaine Maxwell's criminal trial, an image of an e-mail from Epstein's servers surfaced on-line that shows Musk and Epstein corresponding about Musk meeting Maxwell. https://www.twitter.com/PlainSite/status/1516582255233093633

&gt;6. Musk and his second ex-wife, Talulah Riley, admitted to visiting Epstein's mansion on an unspecified date in the middle of syndicated denial stories, in which Riley was denying being an escort procured for Musk by Maxwell. https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/social/elon-musk-defends-photo-with-ghislaine-maxwell-claiming-he-was-photobombed/news-story/e36a769f65b00f4da5ea22763bdc3ae1

"Have we? Scientists don't even know what the majority of the matter or energy is in the universe, but they're sure they've got it all figured out with a correlation between CO2 and very slightly higher temperatures. What absolute hubris. And any scientist who disagrees is made a pariah and can never find work again. Hm sounds a lot like the coerced 'consensus' around Covid 'vaccine' safety and validity of early treatments like HCQ and IVM.

A philosophical question: if a consensus is gamed through grant money, coercion, censorship, demonisation, is it really a consensus? Hate to break it to you but acaedemia and medicine and science are as captured and corrupted as the Fed, that is to say, in totality.

So CO2 has gone up from like 200 parts per million to 400 (rounding numbers) and that's supposed to be some sort of catastrophe? So that 0.02% to 0.04% change in our atmosphere is going to be catastrophic? They've been saying we're all going to be underwater in 20 years decade after decade, and it's been alarmist bullshit every time. Every single time that 0.02% change makes fuck all difference and all their predictions have been complete and utter bullshit.

'Science' attaches itself to these bullshit dogmas and then makes fun of anyone who dissents, it's a story as old as time. It's a load of bullshit, but it helps to make a fortune if you're legislating the EV lunacy and investing in it. Who'd have thought if you invest in MRNA and mandate 'vaccines' you'll become rich? Who'd have thought turning against oil in favour of the EV lunacy would create kings in TSLA? Well Pelosi sure saw em coming for one.

If you want to carry on with your blinders and believe what the globalists tell you, that's fine. Inflation is caused by Putin and muh supply chain. Trans rights are more important than anything and women should be referred to as possessors of wombs so as to avoid offence. Global food security isn't an issue. Covid 'vaccines' are safe and effective. We'll all be underwater in 20 years (again) from global warming. Open immigration is always good for a society. Roll up your sleeve for the experimental gene drugs with no long-term safety data and wear your mask at all times; they want their consumers scared and faceless. You will own nothing and be happy (though let's face it, your happiness is very much secondary to them owning everything).",negative

"NIO must over deliver. Hitting the guidance for 180k deliveries will not cause the stock price to go up since it was already trading at very high multiples. At the time of posting this, NIO was still over $30. The price cratering is already in effect. At this point, we're in price discovery and the bottom could be much lower.

I still stand by the fact that deliveries are the only thing that matters. NIO must show a path to get to 1M vehicles produced before their legacy competitors of VW, F, GM, and obviously their current competitors of TSLA, XPEV, LI, etc.

VW, F and GM are all projecting 1M EVs per year by 2025. TSLA is already at 1M EVs per year, and are growing capacity at a very fast rate. They are also selling out all cars manufactured, and their choke point is in production and not demand. NIO is a small fish in this quickly tightening market. NIO will not see explosive growth in their stock unless they can quickly scale production to take a market dominant stance.",negative

"Bogus article, ignore it.  The only coins that might go up are gold coins, real coins. Nothing digital is going to escape additional vaporization.  On CNBC right now they are discussing if Bitcoin can hold $30.  No one knows but as I have been saying for many months, once cryptos crash there really is no bottom, no support level without already bleeding whales doubling down. Someone was trying to prop cryptos up yesterday but now the carnage continues. 

My guess is that those early crypto holders who had massive profits may be looking at their portfolio balances and panicking, and when fear takes over, it trumps greed. 

In general, we have a major re-set correction in the entire market. Not many winners, but those that are holding up are value stocks with low PE's and major cashflows. We are also waiting on the Fed and for AAPL and other major tech earnings this week. If those become the cataysts for a big rebound, then most stocks will zoom back, but maybe not cryptos o TSLA and a lot of cypto companies may go out of business like oil-gas firms did during the $20 a barrel swoon during the covid lockdowns or the 2008 crash for banks and brokerages.",negative

"[&gt; how do I buy VTI   This question makes me think you are asking how to invest at all? VTI is just a financial asset you can buy and sell with a brokerage account. Just like you can go and put in an order for Apple, or Google, a bond fund, or a Target Retirement Date Fund, you can put in an order for VTI.  You don't have to actually have a Vanguard account to buy/sell VTI even though VTI is a product made by Vanguard. In fact, you can buy VTI (or VXUS or VT or ...) on pretty much any brokerage like Fidelity, Schwab, TD Ameritrade or app like Robinhood or M1Finance.  VTI is just an index fund that tracks a total US stock market index (as defined by the (https://www.crsp.org/products/investment-products/crsp-us-total-market-index) in the case of Vanguard). **An  underlying index is different from an index fund, which tracks an index** There are many other products like ITOT from the iShares organization (managed by Blackrock), SCHB from Schwab, FSKAX or FZROX from Fidelity, the mutual fund version of VTI called VTSAX from Vanguard, etc.   All of these track some type of total US Stock market index, you just have to pick which company whose product you want. Once you picked a company, you can buy their product on any of the brokerages. So you can buy VTI on Fidelity, FSKAX on Vanguard, SCHB on TD Ameritrade, etc.  Similarly, VT is the Vanguard product that tracks a global stock market index (there are a few such underlying indices, MSCI, CRSP, even the S&amp;P company has one). You can buy VT from any brokerage. And on any brokerage, you can buy any version of VT that another company offers, like Schwab (SWTSX) or iShare's ACWI.  You see VTI, VT, etc. most often because Vanguard is a very popular company. But you can certainly get equivalent products from other companies, and buy it on any brokerage you like.](/r/stocks/comments/ulkp5x/please_stop_recommending_overcomplicated/i84smn1/)

[Well prior to 2021 I was all mutual funds.   In fact I never changed them and rode things out buy putting more into my account with Fidelity.  I also dump the max into 401k.  The last time I traded was 2000.  Then 2021 came along and I got the bug because of Robin Hood and Stash.  Soon that was not enough so I went with a company that provides tools and acres to research.  Bought into other research tools, tried many.  So I started in June 2021 and bought NVDA, LAC, HRZ, COP, PLUG, AAPL, MSFT.  I then bought into some losers and maintained a struck 15% loss and I am out was not waiting for a recovery.  Anything that was a looser got channeled into AA, ABBV which I sold and now am with WMT, and AAL, DAL. The stocks I mentioned made for my based which did ok.  Picking a loser and reallocating has been an issue since they are realized losses.  Some of those have recovered in March and dropped in April.  As it stands I am down 3.02%. If it would not have been for the foundation stocks I bought it could be worse.  Many of those got beat up but but not to my open price.](/r/stocks/comments/ubh43f/everyone_who_started_investing_investing_during/i66hued/)

"The criticism wrt. the poor track record of the news source is noted - but the following are also true:

- Bill Gates has or had a significant short position against Tesla

- **Source**: [Techrights: ""At Microsoft, ‚ÄúFear Uncertainty Doubt (TALKING POINTS)‚Äù is Formal Strategy""](http://techrights.org/2009/01/04/fear-uncertainty-doubt-strategy/)
- Bill Gates has not denied this report so far. [Since Elon Musk has reacted to the news already](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1529096925609328640) I'd expect Bill Gates to confirm or deny this news.",negative

&gt;the largest issuer of chinese bonds is about to go bankrupt
&gt;insiders dumping, bonds have lost 60%+ of their value, chinese banks no longer allowed to give mortgages to customers buying evergrande ghost apartments
&gt;7th largest property developer in the world
&gt;lost 80% of its share price
&gt;the entire chinese junk bond market will collapse if the CCP allows evergrande to go under 
&gt;evergrande no longer allowed to issue bonds, have flooded the market with short term CP instead to stay afloat
&gt;Tether have confirmed they own Chinese commercial paper
&gt;Tether is 80% of BTC volume
&gt;even if tether once had $64 billion dollars, the value of their chinese commercial paper would be down at least 30%, and at least 50% if it's evergrande
&gt;there's no way they can exit their position holding such a huge amount of paper
&gt;if evergrande goes bankrupt, tether goes to 0
&gt;If Tether goes to 0, 80% of crypto volume disappears overnight
&gt;Bitfinex would dump their 200k BTC holdings as the executives try to flee
&gt;Tether exchanges would almost definitely do the same - they hold another 600k BTC
&gt;confidence will be destroyed as institutional idiots realize they have done absolutely no dd on crypto and just fomod into green lines
&gt;big bags will have to be liquidated - MSTR would collapse and liquidators would come for its 110k BTC, desperate to sell before the market collapses to try recoup their $500m SECURED bonds
&gt;NASDAQ would dump
&gt;TSLA would dump
&gt;probably market-wide correction of at least 20% as overleveraged institutions get margin-called
&gt;US junk bond market defaults become widespread
&gt;interest rates on junk bonds skyrockets

&gt;even profitable companies would have to reign in dividends, buybacks, and cut spending to pay down their debt load

TSLA has long been the most overvalued stock in the market and Musk is not a stable or very wise individual.   It has always been absurd to value Tesla at three times Toyota, the world's #1 car maker, especially since Toyota can sell its products everywhere but Tesla is limited to wealthy liberal areas which have a lot of Ev infrastructure. also Tesla's next earnings report is likely to be lousy and show lack of growth.    It is quite possible that TSLA will be the last big bubble to burst and hit $350. That would also signal the end of the market crash and re-set.  So like Netflix?  Yes, very similar in fact.

Also a cruel joke on Musk that by cashing out and borrowing on margin to buy Twitter, and especially to do us a dirty deed by promoting trumpism, that Musk may have ruined not only his reputation, but lost over 100 billion dollars,   So the real cost of Twitter could be more than twice what he agreed to pay.",negative

[Dude, it's not propaganda. That was a report published by Onlyfans. They removed 15 accounts for CP, which is fuck all compared to the user base, but it was still there.   I'm just reading between the lines, but it appears to me that after the PornHub thing the payment processors wanted Onlyfans to prove that there was no CP on their platform. And there was. So now, the payment processors are saying we refuse to support your business because there's no regulation and you can't guarantee that more CP won't be uploaded.  Again, this is my take on the situation based on Onlyfans' report and the similarities with the PornHub situation.  It's been proven that the user-uploaded pornography model is able to be abused for CP. Like everything else, a few idiots ruin things for everyone.  &gt;They've been using ""save the kids"" to write laws about porn forever now  As they should... The alternative is no regulation whatsoever. And no laws are being written here anyways.

"You don't even need to look at numbers to know that AMC is a pump 'n dump from the very start.

Go to any SHF sponsored ""news"" source (Motley, MarketWatch, CNBC, etc) then search for GME news and note all of the AMC articles/references when you search for GME. Now do the same search for AMC.

See the difference there? There's not really many references to GME when you search for AMC, but there is the other way around... hmmm... And notice how 99% of all references to GME (in AMC articles) are in a negative framing?

I noticed a similar very clear pattern while TSLA was still being suppressed by SHF: CNBC was constantly going on about how Elon Musk Tweeted something ludicrous or how Tesla was almost bankrupt (again). Everything about it was negative spam 100% of the time.

My conclusion: AMC is actively being pushed through hedge-fund propaganda channels. SHF profit from this in 3 ways: 

1. Ordinary pump 'n dump: SHF buy in early, manipulate retail into buying, drive price up and then sell at the higher price, 
2. Distracting retail buyers from the real problem for SHF's: their insane short position in GME. 
3. Frame GME in the media as \*another AMC, just another one of the meme stocks driven by dumb Reddit buyers who are conspiring to manipulate stocks together\*. When GME pops, they will have planted the idea that the disaster was somehow caused by retail buyers, because ""look at AMC and all those other stocks too"". 

SHF propaganda channels are the ones I mentioned above (MSM), but also WSB, the many AMC-bot subs, Twitter bots, etc. Whereas they're doing everything they can to distract from GME in those same channels. They distract from GME by focusing/tagging attention towards AMC and other ""meme stocks"". By ""meme stocks"" I mean: pump 'n dumps in broad daylight orchestrated through those same SHF sponsored propaganda channels. You all know the tickers: AMC, NOK, BB, SNDL, RKT and so on and so forth. Pump 'n dumps. In ""regulated"" markets.

Like, I get that things aren't exactly *great* out there, but how can anybody think that inflation/recession is even close to the Global Financial Crisis? The catalyst for an apocalyptic crash just isn't there. Unless y'all know about a black swan event coming that nobody else is aware of. In which case, care to share with the rest of the class?

[A majority going into Twenty22 (Q1) would be beaten-down one way or another. I would think.   My most favorite (forever) long-term hold that has a couple of bruises GRMN. Bought 140 last year, ATH 180 in August , currently ninety-seven *sigh*, DCA at 105 in May, trade price now 123. Buying more soon.  Market sentiment tends to move this stock up, down intraday, otherwise great business all-around, good fundamentals, and product launches boost the stock price on occasion.

A capitulation down leg is still a possibility this summer if it's going to happen it's going to happen in the next month or two the VIX/VXN has been steadily making higher lows this entire year both are pushing on the door of a volatility explosion which would be the capitulation leg down.  (https://www.tradingview.com/x/ddLwUklb/) This is the move I think is most likely I think Nasdaq will backtest the covid gap down before bottoming it's also at a very strong trendline and roughly a 50% retracement from ATHs.  I think you will know we are close to a bottom when you see low cap growth outperforming things like Apple. Right now I think Apple is the short play of a lifetime because no one is expecting a huge drop. But I think Apple is going down to at least 100 by the end of the year.](/r/stocks/comments/vd7exg/how_long_does_it_take_for_the_10_year_yields_to/icks9ta/)

[Typically banks do worse in times of higher rates. Typically the margins get compressed on these (cost to borrow, cost to store capital, cost to acquire new clients all increase) and the risk increases (default rate increases typically in the area where previously thought to be lower at a higher rate than expected). Plus due to the higher rates, they are looked at as predatory and so have to spend more to counter the effect.  For purely a rate play and not a recession play, you'll need something with an inelastic demand curve. Oil is one of these but it's already sitting at pretty much ATH and as history has said, that doesn't last. Would look into health care (UNH), core consumer staples (JNJ), insurance (MET), and ""cheap"" release stocks (DEO, ATVI, KO) where consumers use them to supplement their mood in times of stress.   For a recession play, would go the basket route and look into an increasing stake in small-caps (IWM) as they tend to have the most dramatic recovery. If you believe the US is going to recover before the rest of the world, then look into a basket of importers as they will have stronger buying power (VCR).](/r/stocks/comments/vcpmi9/who_are_the_winners_in_high_rates/icg4xq9/)

So if you're holding $1m and in the next 2 months stocks return to ATH, you may still have $1m cash, but when the market comes back and you're ready to invest again because things have stabilized, you won't be able to buy nearly as many shares; but you'll still buy anyway because to you it won't make sense to hold cash when the market is ""obviously"" going to slowly increase.](/r/stocks/comments/vcap0f/anyone_here_less_then_5_cash/icdnb5t/)

"Bjorn Nyland did a trip to Slovenia in a model Why. 

In the third video you can see the trip meter at 1646 km (1022 mi) with an average consumption of 223 Wh/km (359 Wh/mi).

Even if he drove 130 km/h (80 mph) on average, the fact remains the range would only cover 206mi (35% below EPA).

The fat e-tron (you know, the one the stans laughed with as it only has a 204mi EPA range) could still do 185mi at the same speed (130 km/h) according to a test by Nextmove. Which is only 9% below its EPA range.

When the most heavy and least aerodynamic car of the two loses less (official) range at higher speeds, you know the EPA-ranges are just BS.

Furthermore, $TSLA bricks aren't supposed to be charged to 100% time after time (especially on the SuC), so his range is even lower (185mi at 90% and 165mi at 80%).

He is lying.  And that is a problem with him. He lies. And he lies the most when he is in the grip of his untreated mental illness, which he exacerbates with copious amounts of pot. Friends in California who knew him 7 or 8 years ago know for a fact that he was crushing up and snorting adderall. He stands a reasonably chance of OD'ing on whatever he is doing now, but I think his manic depression will be what actually kills him. Regardless, he provides a playground that many people can use to make money. I don't take TSLA seriously as an EV Car play in the long run.

It was never suppose to be an instant process. They have not closed their short positions and no one is forcing them to close yet. 

Time will come when the music will stop. U just have to HODL. If lot then feel free to go back for ur 9-5 job and invest in some other stocks. 

Be a part of the rigged machine. Another cog.

Edit: don‚Äôt get me wrong and I see you are tired and there are many others who are tired but hang in there. HODL For BLUPRINCE, for smaller apes who are hodling single digit GMEs. HODL to change the world. HODL for planet earth. HODL for underprivileged kids. HODL for changing carbon emissions, HODL for ur parents, kids, bf, gf, friend.

Just HODL.

People looking at recent big winners and projecting excessively into the future is the game that actively managed funds have played, and lost at, for decades. The point of my response to the question is that it hasn't been a winning strategy. It doesn't mean any single stock may not win. Just that as a philosophy, a half century or so of failure kinda makes me skeptical of it.  You're perfectly welcome to your zeal, and you should invest accordingly.

Rationale: But the only way a squeeze could happen (other than the technicals) is an indication of a real business. Thats what happened late 2020/early 2021 with anticipation of the USPS contract - WKHS went from single-digit unknown to $40s.

Also learnt from the TSLA story that its hard to get production at scale right for new tech and many have tried/are trying hard. WKHS will need to prove they can produce (or partner with a production facility) before I will bank on them being an investible long-term business.

That said, its a calculated risk long-term as they could quickly go from less than $1bn market cap to $20bn...but might be a long wait for that confirmation.

"I really wish people would understand that this is all in stock.  Not cash.

This isn‚Äôt his money either, it‚Äôs the companies from investors.

If he sold all of his stock TSLA would be worthless.  I know I‚Äôm probably going to get a lot of shit for saying this, but this isn‚Äôt someone who is a problem to society.  If anything, he‚Äôs the complete opposite where with investors money, he‚Äôs going to shape the future of science and the world around us.

The greedy billionaire that ARE a problem would be Ken Griffen of Citadel. The Walton family. Elizabeth Holmes. Nancy Pelosi. Gavin Newsome. Benny Hinn. Joel Osteen. Steve Cohen.

All of these people are filthy rich and still continue to take more from society than they‚Äôll ever likely give back.

Elon is his company.  If he sold his stock, sent it to a tax haven and sought to still cheat the public, then yes, he‚Äôd be a bad guy.  But if the system is going allow this amount of wealth, I‚Äôd rather it be him and what could amount from it than what most other scum bag billionaires are doing.

Has anyone heard of Tesla paying their employees piss ass money? What about dangerous working conditions forced into by coercion? Nope!

You can DEF say this about Jeff Bezos.  People are working ridiculous hours and they can barely make rent all while he makes a bill each week.",negative

So here me out.....Some Bull Analysts in 2020 were predicting TSLA to be $2000 in 2021 but due to random catastrophic macro catalyst events....it didn't happen. So at the very least....TSLA will be $2000 in 2022.....Right.....,negative

I look forward to a) NIO monthly deliveries being one third of TSLA (50k Vs 150k) b) EV monthly revenues being 50% of TSLA as NIO ASP will be much higher c) NIO Gross Margins INCLUDING ADaaS being 30% (same as TSLA). Remember capitalizing ADaaS may ADD value of RMB 50,000 to NIO ADaaS EV.

Quickly fell apart and watched TSLA profit from yesterday evaporate.  Scaled in on some puts on SPX on C session when it broke ONL 4780.

I think TSLA calls 15 mins after open are in order. Gotta be near max fear for shorter term holders.  Although might have to wait to see if double bottom around 630.,negative
"I don‚Äôt think so. Everyone says TSLA is more than a car company. I say that‚Äôs dangerous. When a company start moving away from their core business model they loose focus on who they are. Look at T‚Ä¶terrible 15 year gains because they tried to become more than a telephone service. Now they‚Äôre splitting the company up to move back to their core business model. GE is the same way, got too big and now splitting up the business.",negative

TSLA 1100Cs FDs are 24 bucks. Incase anyone was wondering.,negative

Of course the first NFTs sold for millions. It's new, it's fancy and people always struggle with their transience.

In early 2017, TSLA had 40 Billion market cap after the release of Q4 '16 results.  

* The company had negative cash flow of 123.8 Million from operations, and an additional negative 1.42 Billion from building infrastructure that year.  
* The balance sheet was ugly:  just 3.4 Billion in cash compared to 3.1 Billion in Accounts payable + Accrued liabilities, and close to 5.9 Billion in long-term debt.  
* Tesla had a single factory with a single production line and built less than 84,000 cars that year

By comparison, Palantir in Q3 2021

* Has positive cash flow of 119 million for the quarter, 400+ million for the year expected
* Has 2.5 Billion in cash and marketable securities on hand, against less than 200 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and zero (0) long term debt.
* Does not need to build an extremely complex, capital-intensive physical manufacturing and supply chain infrastructure

So the question I have is this: are people actually looking at the health of the business behind PLTR stock?  Or are they panicking because other people are panicking in a manic market situation?  I think it's the latter.",negative

Just one person was able to hold on to their shares until the company was included in the S&amp;P500 Index.  Everyone else either Noodle Handed their shares and sold out of panic at a loss, or sold at breakeven because they didn't like the stress. 

My default answer if anyone asks me for stock tips, is that they should buy Index Funds and just let them sit for decades.

[TSLA down to $900, still $400 down to go IMHO. Wouldn't touch it under under $500 and even then the EV craze doesn't feel as strong as it used to be, plus they have so SO much competition now, maybe even Apple Cars.  And Elon Musk may be a genius but he not a stable one and shows poor management traits very often, almost Trumpian.  He lost my respect when after admitting that Doggiedoocoin was a scam, he then flip-flopped and said he will take it as payment for cars. Made no sense unless he was playing it for personal gain and manipulating the market. Also, never a good sign when the CEO sells a massive chunk of stock which Musk did last month.   As for the rest of the market, the sell-off may be over now.  When it was down 800 points that felt like capitulation.  AAPl was down 7 and why?  No reason just because it is a stock.

As for SNDL I believe they diluted themselves into their current position but maybe I'm remembering that wrong.

"Ok, I can sort of understand that perspective, but my ""First Principles"" of the public markets result in me genuinely not caring about the valuation of any company I'm not invested in.

1. **Markets are often extremely unreasonable in the short run.**  This is an immutable reality of the stock market.  Consequently, there is no point in caring whether the valuation of a particular company makes sense or not, since I as a retail investor have no control over it.  By most standards, I have acquired substantial wealth over the past 25 years, but my ""market power"" today is not even a fraction of a drop of water in the multi-Trillion dollar securities ocean. 
2. **Markets overall are not personal.**  The broad markets are not out to get anyone, although there may be actors within the market (like paid FUDsters) who need to be fought.  Consequently, I believe people should not take offense at how the markets move in aggregate. 
3. **Fairness is irrelevant.**  The only thing that matters is one's rate of return over one's time horizon, and whether that is sufficient to achieve one's financial goals.  If a RIVN investor does well or does poorly, I really don't care.   The other aspect of this is that TSLA investors should fight to win.  One reason I'm mostly here now instead of TIC or TMC (which I left permanently), is that this community is willing to openly and ruthlessly fight FUDsters and other bad actors.  I don't care if we aren't fair in fighting them, as they never had any intention of being fair to us (and I've seen every dirty FUD trick in the book that these folks threw at TMC -- and the TMC mods/admins just rolled over for years).

I can‚Äôt believe what I am seeing and yes might be time to call MoM‚Ä¶ but earnings and FS in mega cap(ex TSLA) are more than justified valuations(actually far under for the MAGA complex) and will hold up the indices for now.

It doesn't matter whether I sell 45 DTE or 2 DTE. Every time I sell an option, the strike is just like a magnet that the stock price immediately moves to. Example: This Tuesday, I finally called it quits on my 950P, after rolling it from 1000, after rolling it from 1050, where I originally opened it when the stock price was $1200, and then I decided to sell a 1080/1110 CCS, which was basically ITM 2 days later.",negative

[Tesla is already a better highway AP than BlueCruise and Supercruise, they just don't let you go hands free.  Perhaps when their driver monitoring gets rolled out.  The only times I don't use it 100% of the time are in construction zones with major lane shifts (though it does seem to handle them for the most part, just slows down abruptly sometimes) or when making turns on city streets.     After watching the FSD beta videos, it seems like turns are already mostly finished, though some patience is required.

[Here's a bear case I posted below, we've been down this road before. Only about 6 years ago. I hope you all do well with the stock tho:  SMRs are being designed but not built. There is an immense amount of red tape with the NRC to bring any new design to the market. This is why BWR style reactors have been the standard for building. They are a technology tested and understood by the regulators. This was why the 2 most recent nuclear ventures in the US were westinghouse design AP 1000. In both Voglte GA and Jenkinsville SC. One, in SC, is abandoned after spending close to 20 bil and causing Westinghouse to file for chapter 11. Additional fall out was SC energy co-op sce&amp;g selling to Dominion energy. Multiple federal fraud cases are still pending. In GA they actually did get reactors built and I believe the majority are running, but also at cost of 20b. Of that 20b the rate payers are footing the majority of the bill. Westinghouse was owned by Toshiba before the chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. They also had ties tepco (Tokyo electric power company) and the entire Japanese nuclear fleet which they aspired to monopolize. After Fukushima, a tax fraud event, and then the debacle of Jenkinsville Toshiba was forced to sell to Brookfield Asset Management (BAM). There are no known new BWR sites in development in the US. Putting all this faith into SMRs is kinda sketchy. Toshiba also thought a nuclear Renaissance was under way. Then one event a world away changed it all. Be careful.  Additionally, all the old reactors are being decommissioned. This technology is feared by many, understood by few, and no one wants it in their back yard. A very steep mountain to climb for this tech to have meaning in the future.](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pko849/uranium_supply_squeeze_is_on/hc5clpc/)

It‚Äôs already a somewhat arbitrary and sector-specific number, but I don‚Äôt see how the supply-demand curve would allow inflation to continue in a mostly-healthy economy.

I won‚Äôt pretend Daddy Government didn‚Äôt do us a favor but I think it will continue to prop the economy up as needed. We can‚Äôt have a pandemic every year, but the occasional ‚Äúeconomic volatility‚Äù can be money-printed away. This is the new norm. I‚Äôm skeptical about a ‚Äúbig bill run‚Äù from here until the fall and then a ‚Äúbig crash‚Äù. Maybe a modest bull run followed by a crash, maybe flat followed by more flat.

"TSLA is a growth stock.  Burry expects massive inflation.  Inflation is bad for growth stocks.  Burry also thinks TSLA is overvalued.

People who short at the right times sometimes get glorified for some strange reason, and get more respect than they deserve.  They are often wrong.  

&amp;#x200B;

Two things that Burry often gets glorified for are:

1) He shorted before the housing bust.  Note that he had been short for three years.  He shorted in a very complicated way using credit default swaps.  Note that in the first two years his fund lost money.  Then it made over 200% year that the market crashed.  Realize that he could have made significantly more money in the market crash by simply buying puts on the most effected stocks.  Some people overestimate the amount of money he made by shorting the housing bust, but really his return did not account for his risk.  Also realize that investors that had poor returns during the housing bust, yet kept very bullish positions before, during, and after have massively outperformed Burry overall.  Yet bullish investors are often less glorified than shorts.

2) He bought GME at $4.  Note that he sold at $19.",negative

They are evil, they aren't stupid.

The US and Europe realise this perfectly well, and they would never start a sanctions war against China. Firstly, because even the sanctions against the much less meaningful Russia are backfiring in a big way, paving the way for a recession (or a depression if the bear gets really angry). Second, because the degree of interconnection is so brutal that it would be a mutual economic massacre.

The reality is that China and India will cut the monopoly of Swift, damage the dollar position as world currency as much as they can and, in general, remember what the West can do to them.

All the rest will continue exactly as it is.

As to TSLA, there is a reason why they chose China. They know that Winnie the Pooh wil never touch them. Never, ever. It would be the equivalent of Pearl Harbor. The Chicoms would be made to pay a very high price for it. Not because the US admin likes Musk, but because they can't absolutely allow an affront of the sort to happen.

[Damn right up until that last paragraph I was really empathetic and concerned. Then when I saw that you bet the house on AMC, and not even a sensible meme stock like GME‚Ä¶ Jesus wept. First of all its not free money, its money you pay back with a fee, and any stocks purchased on margin can be lent out by your broker in order to short the stock. So you actively hurt your stock by buying it on margin and not direct registering. Secondly AMC is a failing business, thats not FUD, look at it objectively, they have nothing of substance going for them unlike GME. Yes shorted meme stocks might pop, but its a good idea to invest in a stock with not laughable fundamentals, that are riding trends and not cashing in on gimmicks, insiders who buy stock instead of dumping it, dont lie about their partnerships and talk a big game without putting their money where their mouth is. Amc has always been a distraction meme stock, face up with your failed bet, work your ass off to pull yourself out of this absurdly idiotic hole you dug yourself in. You now have to prove your actions may have been stupid but that doesnt mean you have to commit to being stupid. I really hope this is a joke and you didnt get fooled by Wish.com GME](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uoxsux/has_anyone_here_been_margin_called_im_worried/i8hqmwr/)

Expected low of the day ... 388.  It's entirely possible that we moon on the back of TSLA.  Everyone hated that TWTR deal.  If there's a giant ""Fuck you"" backlash, then it could get ugly.  GME could do its thing today also out of sheer spite.  Bet against GME at your peril.  That's enough rambling.

AEI and TSLA.. maybe DKNG again,negative
I‚Äôm certain SPY will be green Monday simply due to TSLA. It has mad momentum and it‚Äôs gone full regard mode. 75% of SPY names could be down and SPY could still be up bigly due to the TSLA rally extending into next week.,negative
"Here is my logic on why it‚Äôs a guarantee: QYLD is a perfect example.  I think it‚Äôs dropped appreciation by 11% in the past 5 years.  (I don‚Äôt know the exact number but it has dropped so I‚Äôm not focused on that.) The dividend has paid out more in that timeframe than the appreciation has lost with the CC ETF.  If you had TSLA that doesn‚Äôt pay a dividend and it has the same drop then you have lost money whereas a dividend stock you still get earnings.  Peloton is probably a more appropriate example.  Those that bought at 88 now have ~62 dollar stock for a loss and nothing to make up for the loss.  

Therefore, it is a guarantee return on Capitol.  Everything has its risk which I didn‚Äôt mention but doesn‚Äôt need to be mentioned as that the general understanding of the stock market.",negative
