1. Canada/Australia and some parts of the USA have a massive housing bubble; that has not yet ""burst"" ... higher rates w/lower markets (leading to less liquidity) could be the trigger.

High oil prices are akin to a ""tax"" (paid to oil/gas exporting nations). So higher taxes, higher oil, higher rates =&gt; lower earnings likely.
3. ""Zero"" covid shutdowns, supply chain disruptions, higher shipping prices, excess inventories etc have not yet been fully reflected in earnings (example $TSLA had slightly lower deliveries than expected, this in turn is likely to lead to lower earnings, in the current qtr - and this is a very well managed supply chain!)
4. Dollar is stronk! That usually hurts corporate earnings; example: Apple prices in China/India/Europe/Brazil etc will be higher than last year, simply due to FX, leading to marginal reduction in demand (or FX losses for Apple). Either ways, lower earnings from international markets (&gt;50% of Apple profits!).",negative

"Just by looking at your post, sell PLUG, FCEL and BLDP immediately. I also don‚Äôt mention anything about the ‚Äúfuture‚Äù of the company. No one knows for sure how the future will pan out, so first I like to look at the financial standpoints, and see if it‚Äôs worth the risk based on their future. 

As for the rest: 

GOOGL: Lowest PE since 2013, but PEG is 1.07. Still considered ‚Äúovervalued‚Äù by traditional metrics. PS ratio is still above average at 5.8, but since the company is posting consisting revenue and profit, this can somewhat be ignored. These guys increased their debt by 3x when the pandemic hit, but even then, they‚Äôre DTE is still 0.06. Also considering the fact they‚Äôre a huge, dominating company, they can afford to take on debt and handle it. I bring in debt because usually in high interest rate environments, small companies tend to not survive or have a hard time.

TSLA: Reason I stay away from this one, is despite the fact that their revenue is increasing and the demand for EV has grown, the current stock price shows they still have a lot to prove. Since they bare starting posting consecutive net profit, I still judge them by their PS ratio, which is still very high at 12.5. They have relatively little debt as well compared to their equity, but if you feel comfortable holding at TODAY‚ÄôS price, then do so. Keep in mind they must have a perfect plan executed to justify the current stock price, which for me is too much to ask for.

PEP, WM, KO: I won‚Äôt even look into these because I know their ratios are relatively high, aka overvalued. But that‚Äôs the thing about stable blue chip stocks. Especially these. They‚Äôre future is damn near 100% guaranteed. These are the only stocks I‚Äôd purchase without worrying about their financial ratios, as long as your comfortable willing to overpay for them.

F: PS and PE ratios look great. But have very high debt to equity. In a high interest rate environment, I wouldn‚Äôt hold this. This is a mere bet on the future. Will they be able to catch up to Tesla on the EV tech? I wouldn‚Äôt hold if your goal is to preserve wealth. Too risky, there‚Äôs better stocks out there.

AMZN: One of my favorites, that I DO NOT own just yet. Just like Google, this company is dominating online retail, and expanding more. But for the purpose of this comment, only financials. PE is still high at 50, though hasn‚Äôt been this low since 2015. Many argue, and yes, they are reinvesting into their future, but that still poses huge risk assuming you‚Äôre trying to preserve wealth. But that‚Äôs the whole point of investing isn‚Äôt it? So final answer depends on you. Is this PE justified? Their PEG ratio is 1.49, meaning it‚Äôs still overvalued. Needs to drop down 33% from todays price to be a buy for us traditional investors. Will it drop by this much? Who knows, but I don‚Äôt care, there‚Äôs better buys in other companies right now. No need to rush into this.

GLAD: Young company but doesn‚Äôt seem to survive on debt, so that‚Äôs good news. PS is still too high historically, so todays price would be a no for me. Dividend is consistently growing so that‚Äôs also good news. I guess if you have a good reason for this besides ‚Äúthe future looks bright‚Äù, you should have trust in yourself.

PSEC: Same case as GLAD, with higher debt on its balance sheet. High PS ratio, dividend has had a couple hiccups but still growing. If you trust it, go ahead.

XOM: PE ratio is historically low, but PS ratio is historically high. Low PEG of 0.52. From a traditional standpoint, this is a buy. 

I Didn‚Äôt cover the ETFs because they‚Äôre typically well diversified so there‚Äôs no point.

Check the PS, PE, PB, PFCF, ROE, Margins, Debt to Equity, etc. On the ones I didn‚Äôt mention. Plug, FCEL, BLDP. Just insane. Stay away.",positive

Regarding FUBO, I personally have a subscription and think it‚Äôs a good service, so there‚Äôs that bias‚Äînot that it makes it a good stock to own.

"Sure, extremely high risk, high potential upside, but no risk management in there. Sure, you are young, which means more risk and more concentration are reasonably viable, but concentration without risk managements just amplifies the potential downside.

As for analysts, our opinions differ here. I think analyst price targets or buy ratings are absolutely ass. But I don't think EPS and revenue projections are - and we can all see that they are usually quite decent at doing these projections, so my take is that 1.) they have done a lot more work trying to understand the company and its opportunity than most people out there 2.) their accuracy is generally quite useable. Use with cautious, of course, and I do try to come up with my own estimates as well, I also put a margin of safety on their assumptions. But generally speaking the direction they give you is quite decent.

Okay, so you are hopeful about them maybe being able to acquire some market share from cable. What else? Surely you have more of a thesis if you put 10% in a high risk play.

As for the other companies, don't get me wrong, I think they're solid, but I wouldn't be surprised to see your portfolio at -20% from today in a year either. (Wouldn't be surprised if it was up either)

I agree that TSLA is your riskiest of the three, because the valuation is still insane even after having moderated as much as it has. But 10x? You think TSLA will become a 7T+ market cap? That's a market cap larger than the GDP of every single economy apart from the US and China. TSLA would literally need to execute to utter perfection in every single aspect and that valuation would still be rich imo.

I haven‚Äôt found in my experience that analysts projections have been particularly helpful. They move markets, but are as fickle as any individual investor and  I frankly don‚Äôt trust them.

I‚Äôm hopeful that they will acquire market share from cable cutters seeking to save money during a recession. 

Risking 10% in my 20s with the potential to 10X from a average cost below $3/share is worth it to me. If it files bankruptcy it won‚Äôt be the end of the world for me.

As far as the 90% of my portfolio‚ÄîI‚Äôm confident in these 3 companies. I understand them and want to profit from what they‚Äôre doing.

QCOM is worth going in 30% on solely based on the high dividend. But it also has great valuation with a low PE and high growth potential.

I want to be adding to AMZN at current valuations because we‚Äôre in a rare moment in time where e-commerce is being beaten down by macro conditions. AMZN is not going anywhere and has tendrils in so many areas that will boom in the present and future: E-commerce, SAAS, cloud, space, entertainment, etc. AMZN is a no brainer to me and I hope it continues to drop on the near term.

30% TSLA is my riskiest position imo at current valuations. But it‚Äôs a stock I don‚Äôt mind adding to if it drops massively. I like what Musk is doing and I‚Äôve drunken the Koolaid. I view TSLA as a clean energy/EV/space/AI ETF with potential to 5-10X once markets become risk-on again. I might adjust my portfolio allocation on the short term and trade TSLA for GOOG because I do think a Shopify-like drop is possible and 30% is a large risk.",positive

"Have we? Scientists don't even know what the majority of the matter or energy is in the universe, but they're sure they've got it all figured out with a correlation between CO2 and very slightly higher temperatures. What absolute hubris. And any scientist who disagrees is made a pariah and can never find work again. Hm sounds a lot like the coerced 'consensus' around Covid 'vaccine' safety and validity of early treatments like HCQ and IVM.

A philosophical question: if a consensus is gamed through grant money, coercion, censorship, demonisation, is it really a consensus? Hate to break it to you but acaedemia and medicine and science are as captured and corrupted as the Fed, that is to say, in totality.

So CO2 has gone up from like 200 parts per million to 400 (rounding numbers) and that's supposed to be some sort of catastrophe? So that 0.02% to 0.04% change in our atmosphere is going to be catastrophic? They've been saying we're all going to be underwater in 20 years decade after decade, and it's been alarmist bullshit every time. Every single time that 0.02% change makes fuck all difference and all their predictions have been complete and utter bullshit.

'Science' attaches itself to these bullshit dogmas and then makes fun of anyone who dissents, it's a story as old as time. It's a load of bullshit, but it helps to make a fortune if you're legislating the EV lunacy and investing in it. Who'd have thought if you invest in MRNA and mandate 'vaccines' you'll become rich? Who'd have thought turning against oil in favour of the EV lunacy would create kings in TSLA? Well Pelosi sure saw em coming for one.

If you want to carry on with your blinders and believe what the globalists tell you, that's fine. Inflation is caused by Putin and muh supply chain. Trans rights are more important than anything and women should be referred to as possessors of wombs so as to avoid offence. Global food security isn't an issue. Covid 'vaccines' are safe and effective. We'll all be underwater in 20 years (again) from global warming. Open immigration is always good for a society. Roll up your sleeve for the experimental gene drugs with no long-term safety data and wear your mask at all times; they want their consumers scared and faceless. You will own nothing and be happy (though let's face it, your happiness is very much secondary to them owning everything).",negative

"This is great, I did the exact same trade but used the 680 Puts. I had it on my list due to TSLA's RS in the opening 45mins but saw the same story - the market running out of steam and TSLA looking unlikely to confirm through the prior day's high.

I scaled out too early but I think that was a natural lack of conviction from weeks of choppy markets. 

I went back in at 11.45 on the next bearish cycle and caught the bounce off of 680 too but I took that trade due to TSLA's RW at the time.",positive
"I bought a very little amount of the leverageshares Tsla ETP. Since it trades in London, I could pick some up before US open tomorrow night. 

Just a 'taster' if you will, to get my toes wet. I've always had such a haunted feeling about going short Tesla.",negative
Was there some good TSLA news?,positive
